       "'Absolutely wonderful - silky and sexy and comfortable Love this dress!  it\\'s sooo pretty.  i happened to find it in a store, and i\\'m glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc it\\'s petite.  i bought a petite and am 5\\'8\".  i love the length on me- hits just a little below the knee.  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite. I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me. i initially ordered the petite small (my usual size) but i found this to be outrageously small. so small in fact that i could not zip it up! i reordered it in petite medium, which was just ok. overall, the top half was comfortable and fit nicely, but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap (net) over layers. imo, a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper - it c I love, love, love this jumpsuit. it\\'s fun, flirty, and fabulous! every time i wear it, i get nothing but great compliments! This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie. it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan. love this shirt!!! I love tracy reese dresses, but this one is not for the very petite. i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand. this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress. the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame. not a stranger to alterations, shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment. i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me. i returned this dress. I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person. (store pick up). i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale :-) hte color is really gorgeous, and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly. it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size (bummer, no petite). i decided to jkeep it though, because as i said, it matvehd everything. my ejans, pants, and the 3 skirts i waas trying on (of which i ]kept all ) oops. I ordered this in carbon for store pick up, and had a ton of stuff (as always) to try on and used this top to pair (skirts and pants). everything went with it. the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer, and went well with pencil skirts, flare pants, etc. my only compaint is it is a bit big, sleeves are long and it doesn\\'t go in petite. also a bit loose for me, but no xxs... so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size... I love this dress. i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size. very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style. I\\'m 5\"5\\' and 125 lbs. i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasn\\'t too long. i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses. if you\\'re less busty (34b cup or smaller), a s petite will fit you perfectly (snug, but not tight). i love that i could dress it up for a party, or down for work. i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath. Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs. i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight! the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric. pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year! needless to say it will be going back. This dress is perfection! so pretty and flattering. More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past, they are right on in their estimation of the product. in the case of this dress-if it had not been for the reveiws-i doubt i would have even tried this. the dress is beautifully made, lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality. it is lined in the solid periwinkle-colored fabric that matches the outer fabric print. tts and very form-fitting. falls just above the knee and does not rid Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didn\\'t bother lining the skirt portion (grrrrrrrrrrr).\\nmy stats are 34a-28/29-36 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half, so i would say it\\'s running big.\\nthe straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too.\\ni\\'m 5\\'6\" and it came to just below my knees. This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings. i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings. the size small fit me well - i am usually a size 2/4 with a small bust. in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up (but then perhaps the waist will be too big). the problem with this dress is the quality. the fabrics are terrible. the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly, but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldn\\'t. these are for an hour-glass figure. i am more straight up and down. the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up, i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips - for me. that said, they are really nice. sturdy, linen-like fabric, pretty color, well made. i hope they make someone very happy! Material and color is nice.  the leg opening is very large.  i am 5\\'1 (100#) and the length hits me right above my ankle.  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle, and front pleats to make me fluffy, i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look.  if you are at least average height or taller, this may look good on you. Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did. i wasn\\'t crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model. i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly. crisp and clean is how i would describe it. launders well. fits great. drape is perfect. wear tucked in or out - can\\'t go wrong. A flattering, super cozy coat.  will work well for cold, dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit.  i am 5\\' 5\\'\\', about 135 and the small fits great. I love the look and feel of this tulle dress. i was looking for something different, but not over the top for new year\\'s eve. i\\'m small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look. once i steamed the tulle, it was perfect! i ordered an xsp. length was perfect too. If this product was in petite, i would get the petite. the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that. \\n\\nfits nicely! i\\'m 5\\'4, 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into. \\n\\nthe tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting. I\\'m upset because for the price of the dress, i thought it was embroidered! no, that is a print on the fabric. i think i cried a little when i opened the box. it is still ver pretty. i would say it is true to size, it is a tad bit big on me, but i am very tiny, but i can still get away with it. the color is vibrant. the style is unique. skirt portion is pretty poofy. i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price, although the quality is definitely there. except i wish it were emb First of all, this is not pullover styling. there is a side zipper. i wouldn\\'t have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me.\\n\\nsecond of all, the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath.\\n\\nnot at all what is looks like or is described as. sadly will be returning, but i\\'m sure i will find something to exchange it for! Cute little dress fits tts. it is a little high waisted. good length for my 5\\'9 height. i like the dress, i\\'m just not in love with it. i dont think it looks or feels cheap. it appears just as pictured. I love this shirt because when i first saw it, i wasn\\'t sure if it was a shirt or dress. since it is see-through if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings. i bought a slip, wore the tie in the back, and rocked it with white wedges. you could also wear it as a vest. be careful with the buttons. i haven\\'t had any fall off yet, but i feel like they will. overall it\\'s great for any occasion and it\\'s fun to wear! Loved the material, but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium. im 5\\'5\" and there was atleast 5\" of material at my feet. the gaps in the front are much wider than they look. felt like the dress just fell flat. both were returned. im usually a large and the med fit better. 36d 30 in jeans I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive. this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat. the sleeves are very wide (although long). as a light weight fall coat the sleeves don\\'t need to be as wide because you wouldn\\'t be layerng too much underneath. the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit. i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh The colors weren\\'t what i expected either. the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldn\\'t find anything to really go with it. fabric is thick and good quality. has nice weight and movement to it. the skirt just wasn\\'t for me, in the end. I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them. especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated. don\\'t hesitate. buy this shirt. you won\\'t be sorry..... This sweater is so comfy and classic - it balances a quirky hand-knit look with a beautiful color and practical fit. it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style, and as others mentioned, there are gaps in the knit that make it see-through. in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering! i like having a longer camisole showing underneath, or wearing it over a little dress. it\\'s warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat. Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop. so much cuter in person. love these! I never would have given these pants a second look online, in person they are much cuter! the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering. the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend. this brand has always run small for me, i am 5\\'8 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly. i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer These pants are even better in person. the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned. I ordered this 3 months ago, and it finally came off back order. a huge disappointment. the fit wasn&#39;t so much the issue for me. the quality of the wool is subpar. someone else mentioned a &quot;felted wool&quot;...i guess, is that what you call it?  it does literally feel like felt! super thin, itchy, doesn&#39;t drape very well, and feels cheap (made in china). i got it on sale, but still not worth what i paid. definitely going back. This is such a neat dress. the color is great and the fabric is super soft. i am tall so the long length was an added bonus. it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps. i am going to pair it with a funky tank top, necklaces and boots. super cute!! Wouldn\\'t have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim. love, love!! This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily. while not the most exciting design, it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops. Just ordered this in a small for me (5\\'6\", 135, size 4) and medium for my mom (5\\'3\", 130, size 8) and it is gorgeous - beautifully draped, all the weight/warmth i\\'ll need for houston fall and winter, looks polished snapped or unsnapped. age-appropriate for both my mom (60\\'s) and myself (30\\'s). will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings. we ordered the gray which is true to the photos. Super cute and comfy pull over. sizing is accurate. material has a little bit of stretch. Great casual top with flare. looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans. flattering with peplum in back. nice cut for shoulders and neckline. Pretty and unique. great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels. the colors, print, and embroidery are lovely. reasonably priced! This is a beautiful top. it\\'s unique and not so ordinary. i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest. although i had a baby this year and i am nursing, so that could be why. if i bought again i would size up. This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design, the colors look like sorbet & cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels. i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring. great buy!! First, this is thermal ,so naturally i didn\\'t expect super sheer, but it is. really sheer light fabric. i like it, but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it. second, it is large. i ordered the size 0 and it\\'s a nice oversized fit for my 5\\'3\" 125 pounds. i wouldn\\'t want to go larger. along with being sheer, the fabric is easily stretched, which i don\\'t mind in this case. finally, the color. it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it. it is so comfortable and flattering. it\\'s too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you can\\'t see the ruching across the front. a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer. 5\\'8\"\" and i generally wear a 6, the small fit well. will probably be back for the black! I bought this item from online... the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight! so i took it back to the store & ordered a larger size. for the sale price this is a great top. I love this top. i wear it all the time.  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade.  i\\'d still recommend it as it is so comfortable. Very comfortable, material is good, cut out on sleeves flattering This sweater is perfect for fall...it\\'s roomy, warm, super comfy and the color really pops. Really cute top! the embroidery on the collar & bib of this top is beautiful and unique, received lots of compliments & questions about where i got it. i\\'m rather busty up top and the medium fit well, a small probably would\\'ve fit better but it\\'s still super adorable. This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall. it fits well, nice print and it\\'s comfortable. i tried this on in the store, but did not purchase it because the color washed me out. this is not the best color for a blonde. would look much better on a brunette. if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it. I absolutely love this bib tee! it\\'s probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time. i\\'m 5\\'7\", 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me. i typically wear either a s or m tops. Love the color and style, but material snags easily Very soft and comfortable. the shirt has an unusual, asymmetrical seam that appears along the front, right-hand side of the garment. (the model is positioned so that you can\\'t see this detail from the picture. i attached a picture that includes the front seam.) i actually like the seam - it creates more visual interest, and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly. the cowl neck is very well done - there are two layers that form the cowl, and i\\'ve found that it means wardrobe malfun Nice top. armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman, i\\'m picky about that. the print is pretty and unusual. it just didn\\'t look great on me. there\\'s a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely. it\\'s a lightweight tee fabric that\\'s opaque. i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible. great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now, that i decided to return since summer is winding down. i do recommend. This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable. i don\\'t usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans. i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit. I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra. it\\'s soft and fits okay, but it has zero support or shape. i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support. if i would have seen this is the store, i would have passed over it. however, i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it. it\\'s comfortable so that\\'s a redeeming quality. i would not recommend for larger chested ladies, though! This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed. but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it. I got this in the petite length, size o, and it fit just right. i like that i didn\\'t have to have it altered in the length; can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem. my only beef with the design is the height of the waist. i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap, and really needs to be concealed with a belt, yet because it sits so high, literally right under the bustline, it\\'s a tricky one to pull off. i have a wide belt that sort of does th I\\'ve been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not binding/tight for night time and casual wear. this is a light weight bra, could be a little more supportive. pretty color, with nice lines. only downside is the retailer tag on the back - itchy (i need to remove it.) This dress is simply beautiful and stunning. it is so figure flattering and i can\\'t wait to wear it. size small worked for me, and since i\\'m tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me. i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail. 3 tags sewn in, 2 small (about 1\\'\\' long) and 1 huge (about 2\\'\\' x 3\\'\\'). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however, this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn\\'t so itchy! I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list. i\\'m so happy with it. its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso (5\\'3). the pattern on the front is very flattering. Very comfortable shirt, light weight top with lovely floral colors. great for spring/summer with white jeans. love everything one september makes! Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale! Beautiful top, but delicate! i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling. other than that it is beautiful and vibrant! just make sure you aren\\'t doing/wearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate Just received this in the mail, tried it on and am smitten. i\\'m usually a l, but sometimes i\\'m a xl (if no stretch), in retailer tops. i bought this one in l and i\\'m sure glad i did. very flowy, stretchy and comfortable. i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a t-shirt and the other is more of a blouse. i almost think i could\\'ve gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me Love this top! i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size, since my post-baby body is a little wonky. i went with the xsp, and miraculously, it works perfectly! so, i would say it does run just a little large..... i love the length, and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular. but this is perfect on me, and there is give up top, so it looks lovely. and it is very soft and comfortable. this will be a go-to top this season! I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person. it is soft and the patter is okay in person. the neckline is higher than i am used to. also, there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top. it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on. unfortunately i had to return this item... I really wanted this to work. alas, it had a strange fit for me. the straps would not stay up, and it had a weird fit under the breast. it worked standing up, but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders. the fabric was beautiful! and i loved that it had pockets. This top is so cute, but it is massively babydoll shaped (a- line) which is not apparent from the pictures. i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42\" and sweep is over 70\". i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter. the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking. i\\'m thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in, but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style. Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can\\'t imagine this would be flattering on anyone, especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous, so if you are like 4\\' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s I have a short torso and this works well for me. 34c, bought the 0. there\\'s not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest, but not in an uncomfortable way. definitely doesn\\'t hang and have extra fabric like on the model. \\n\\nzipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so it\\'s easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric.\\n\\nunlike another reviewer, i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer. wi I love this top. it is loose and comfortable. it is not sheer so you don\\'t need a cami. it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit. 1 criticism, it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful. I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape. i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger. i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style. i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model. it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even. it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi. i believe i will get a lot of wear I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store. i am petite and only 5\\'2\", so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute. there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on, but i think it is still super cute and flattering. i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type. i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted. i am 32c and the top was too big. fit perfectly on hips. the lace material means it cannot be easily altered, so i chose to return the dress. i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit. The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it. very disappointing since i love the design. i\\'m actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger, but annoying that it\\'s come to that. I usually size up with this brand. small was perfect for me at 135lbs. this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful. i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday. it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms. This dress is adorable - it\\'s a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining (though still overpriced, in my opinion). the tie detail is somewhat adjustable, and i found my normal size s to fit fine (5\\'7, 128#). where this gets me is the fact that it\\'s dry clean...totally doesn\\'t make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer. i might bring it back for that alone, since i originally planned to wear it a lot. :( I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i\\'m 5\\'1\" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.\\n\\nthis dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store, salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.\\n\\ni plan to wear it this spring for my daughte Loved this top. great design. comfortable and unique. soft material The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured. i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket. the print is great, i love it! it\\'s so different than any other jackets ive seen. while the jacket is ã¼ber cute, it is a bit bulky (though the waist tie helps with that) and its not heavy winter appropriate ( it\\'s not waterproof or heavily insulated). for your average winter day though, it will be a fun option! the removable v I purchased this top in an antro store last week. the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique. the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders, but can be removed by snaps. i tooks great when worn two different ways. i wore it with the campole out, and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom. it also looks great when the camisole is worn in. my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as it\\'s a touch big at the shoulders and neckli I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly. i?m not crazy in love with it but i also don?t dislike. the shirt is on the thin side. do i need to wear a cami underneath it, no. my concern is holes. it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes. with that being said i?ll wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing. the length is fine and i do like the slits in front?it adds a little dim I was really hoping to like this, but it did not look the way it does on the model, at least not on me. the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser. the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back. i am 5\\'8\" and usually wear a medium or large. i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows. it made me look bigger and was not flattering. material has a nice weave but it\\'s thin and delicate. i bought the (holly) deep olive and the blue. colors I tried this on from the sale section, and they only had a 2 (i usually do 0), and surprisingly, that size was the right fit. it is fitted, with just enough room to eat :-) \\nte blue is a light blue, almost neutral, with the white embroidery, i think it looked stylish, and decided to keep it. the peplum part hit just in the right spot, i am short (petite) but my torso is normal size... I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model, but if i was to tighten it, it looks a lot more flattering... i tried on the xs in the store (i usually do that to decide if i need petite), and it looked huge, when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work, it was a lot of fabric, and looser didn\\'t look as good on me... but i like the dress overall, so still recommend. and for those who like the looser look, this is great. i would, however, order eptite for 5\\'1.5\". (115 lbs, 03 dd che Really cute piece, but it\\'s huge. i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering. returning. I bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it. when i tried it on, the fit was fine but it just lacked...something. the back was a little bit too long, the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after. gorgeous fabric and top, but not for me. i wanted something more for $150! bought the velvet tunic instead ;) I love cute summer dresses and this one, especially because it is made out of linen, is unique. it is very well-made with a design that is quite flattering. i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10. it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give. the perfect dress to wear to italy or france! now i just have to book my tickets! This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model. the pattern and texture are both lovely, and the peplum is surprisingly flattering. it is definitely on the short side, but i think that gives it a modern look. the fabric does not stretch at all, but i still think it fits tts. if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size, but otherwise i would order your normal size. This shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was. i love the shape, design, and and the color. it\\'s perfect for spring and summer with some white pants. unfortunately, i don\\'t see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way. so far, it doesn\\'t work with any of my jeans, skirts, or shorts. i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits, so i\\'m still on the fence if i\\'m going to keep it or not. with that aside, it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful Purchased this top online, and when i received it was very pleased.\\nit has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric.\\nlove that the sleeves run longer......ads to the overall look.\\nalso loved the v neckline.........enhances the feel of the overall style.\\nwith various necklaces this top has limitless options!\\nthe color states moss....which i usually think of as greenish brown......i found it to be more of a taupe.\\nwould have liked it to have a green tones, however it is still a fantastic f I usually wear a medium and bought a small. it fit ok, but had no shape and was not flattering. i love baby doll dresses and tops, but this was a tent. my daughter saw me try it on and said \"that\\'s a piece of tablecloth.\" it\\'s going back. I was very excited to order this top in red xs. so cute, but it was huge, shapeless and support thin! it had to go back. i should\\'ve looked at other reviews. I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear. i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons. when i received it, it looked exactly as it does in the picture online, however, the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big. the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms, which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day. it\\'s definitely a comfortable shirt, but it felt more like a pajama top. it\\'s going back. At first i wasn\\'t sure about it. the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought. but after wearing it, it really is comfortable. it stretches a lot, so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward i\\'m not showing the world my torso. I find that this brand can be a little bit all-over-the-place with sizes. had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m. despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well. i bought a m in another shirt from them (the seamed scoop neck) and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this. just something to keep in mind. still a great shirt, love the neutral color. This top is absolutely stunning. i purchased the white one. just received and it fits nicely-a little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way. this will look great with everything. it is well constructed and looks very unique. love it! The fabric felt cheap and i didn\\'t find it to be a flattering top. for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 38-30-40. Runs big and looked unflattering. i am petite, might work on someone taller. I bought this lovely silk/velvet shirt in the &quot;sky&quot; color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue, which disappointed me. it is definitely darker than appears in photo. still a luxurious well-made beauty with sassy appeal. it drapes like a snake slithering down your body. it comes with attitude. Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt!  and the color sky is gorgeous!  but as another reviewer said--it runs small.  it was also way too short.  so sadly i will be returning this.  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great quality--it just didn\\'t fit me. I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if you\\'re well endowed. it\\'s a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs. haven\\'t decided about keeping it because it looks oversized (but cozy) and it\\'s really long. it almost touches the top of my knees in back. sooooo pretty though. The shirt is exactly as it is pictured, i have the burnt orange color and love it! i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt. it fits true to size, as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders. i would give this top a 5/5. Perfect dress for hot, humid, sticky weather. This is so thin and poor quality. especially for the price. it felt like a thin pajama top. the buttons are terrible little shell buttons. this could not have been returned faster. I didn\\'t end up keeping this dress...it just wasn\\'t right for me. it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin (partially lined which is a plus) and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me. i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slit/vent was just too high for my liking. the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 5\\'4\" (~118#). i guess i just didn\\'t \"love\" it and would rather save my funds for something i ca I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small. i have to totally disagree with the reviewer! i find that this top runs true to size or even generous! the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual! i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit (5\"2\", broad shoulders, 120 lb) This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time. it runs true to size. i\\'m 5\\'1\" 113 lbs and got the xs petite. wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it! The design/shape of the dress are quite flattering, flirty and feminine. but.... there is no way that the dress i received is new. the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area. there is no tag... the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp, stiff or new. i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received. undoubtedly this one is going back.\\n\\ndear retailer - please make sure that you do not send pre-owend clothing articles to This one totally worked for me. love the color, length, and style. Prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress. it definitely needs heels. i\\'m 5\\'4\", 120#, 34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff. This is the perfect summer dress. it can be dressed up or down. the quality of the linen fabric is very nice. i\\'m 5\\'1\" and it hit right below my knees. i found it to run true to size. those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size, but the tie in the front can be adjusted. it\\'s lovely. First, the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer. i really wanted to like this top, but the fitting is so awkward for me. i typically where a 0/xs, and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest (size 32/a). i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow (need a strapless bra) and made it look unflattering overall. had to return this one back to the store. The color is perfect for fall and into winter. only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining. the lining was an unexpected bonus, and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up.\\nthe fit is true to size and the \\'stressed\\' velvet fabric is current for this season.\\ni\\'m going to enjoy wearing this shirt. The perfect striped t-shirt, and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different. i love it! Great look and you can wear this vest with almost everything . i normally wear a small but they only had mediums and it fit fine( i like it tied). this will stay in my closet all year round . it does look like it will wrinkle easily but that doesn\\'t bother me . a must buy ! This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work, to a bbq, or to happy hour. i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely. the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model. After reading the previous reviews, i ordered a size larger. i am so glad i did it! it fits perfectly! i am 5\\'4\"/115/32dd and went with the s regular. so beautiful! i can\\'t wait to wear it! I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral. unfortunately, the shape is \"a\" line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering. so, it will be returned. Like others reviewers mentioned on here, this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me, as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame, but for tall, busty, and curvier girls, it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.\\n\\nhowever, i\\'m a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top. there was entirel I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated- however they are sadly very true. let me be clear that this is a beautiful, comfortable piece of clothing- when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality. and while the pattern is interesting and pretty, the \"dark orange\" color i was expecting is actually a mud brown. i think it\\'s unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket, but i digress. the This coat is beautiful! i love the color and the design. it definitely runs a little large. i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem. i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already. the vest keeps it warm, but the sleeves aren\\'t lined so it\\'s cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if you\\'re going to be in cold weather. Nice vest, pretty olive color, hangs nice but...its just kinda funny. just hangs and really looks odd when tied. i like the laying piece just wished it had more \"umph\". This top is super comfy and casual. the slit/design in the front gives it more of a stylish look than your average white long sleeve tee. would definitely recommend. Intrepid soul that i am, i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle, then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes, shook it out, hung it up, and it is just the same as when it went in. doesn\\'t need to be ironed and didn\\'t shrink. yes, the swing is vast, but that is part of its charm. pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything! i think it is fun, something i will use for years, wonderfully comfort It\\'s ok, fit doesn\\'t wow me because of my body. chest is too wide, hips look too narrow. drapes across my back fat in an especially non-flattering way. basically made my square-apple body look more square-apple. great part about this dress is that it\\'s comfy and hides the tummy pooch. construction is poorly done...contrasting liner at v-neck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally. another negative point is dry clean only. boo. i\\'m 5\\'3\" 140# 39-28-35 an In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section, and it really has more of a jammie top feel... soft, thin and stretchy. it\\'s super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice. mine seems to have stretched out a little, especially the neckline (and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed). i\\'m happy with it though for what it is - a great, casual day t. I love this vest! there are so many ways to style it...open or tied closed, over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans. i get compliments every time i wear it. it\\'s soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavy/hot to wear all day. This blouse is a perfect creation: perfect-weight cotton, many, many details, and color, all perfectly executed. there\\'s fullness to the body, so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot, humid locations this summer, and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look. there\\'s no mistaking quality when you look at this piece! i bought the medium for my 130#, 34f, size 8 blouse/tee frame. this is the blouse you will have for years, and you will enjoy Love this vest! the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really is--it\\'s a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants. a great piece for polished but casual style, and the fabric has a nice, soft suede-like finish.\\n\\nif only the was *slightly* higher to hit my true natural waist, it would get that fifth star (but sometimes i wear petite sizes, so that might be the issue here--still looks good tied). I received the sky color in m online.  am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful.  however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long.  i am 5 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short.  i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot.  but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering. i was excited for this to arrive. this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there. the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat. i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall. the fabric is decent and the weigh The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering, classic and comfortable! the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile - could be worn year-round (so long as it\\'s not 100 degrees out - there is a bit of weight to it). it\\'s one of my favorite pieces in my closet. can be styled 20 different ways. pair with a higher-end tee, tank, denim jacket or body-hugging sweater. i sized down. Perfect for work or going out. i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate. it did not feel scratchy to me, maybe because i layered it. great buy especially with the discounts. feel like i lucked out. It\\'s a pretty top, but it runs very short. the back is also pretty see through so i\\'m not sure i will keep it. it\\'s called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder. great design, just not sure i will keep it due to length Ii\\'m not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it. looks good dressed up w/a nice top or casual w/a tee. can be worn practically all year. love it! My firned tried this on and her first comment was \"take it off, it is scratchy\", so i didn\\'t bother trying it on. it is, however, beautiful, if you are not sensitive to scratchy material.\\nfit was true to size. The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders, but that was kind of snug, perhaps why it didn\\'t fit right, it is not off the shoulders on this picture. the cut is loose, so it looked big on me, but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on... may give it another try on. xs was big, so would need to try the xxs next time. but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me!\\n\\ncolors are nice, light, but appropriate for fall (or summer!) light fabri Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side, but for me, it was big,,, too bad the smaller size is sold out (well, all peittes are sold out). the length is also pretty long, below the knee, but in the narrow part still...so able to keep it. the colors are great. i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists, adn they all loved it and told me to keep it... winner for sure! I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas. i fell in love since i saw it. the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this spring/summer !! and it has pockets on the sides! don\\'t we love pockets? very practical and lightweight This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life. sizing was mostly true to size for me, slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips. i\\'m 5\\'7 and 138# and ordered a size 4 (i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts.) a 6 probably would have fit as well, especially in the waist but didn\\'t want it too big in the hips. length was perfect, to my knees. This skirt is wonderful! the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal, but the quality is impeccable. i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt. it can be dressed up, dressed down, worn during all seasons. the design/pattern is artsy and whimsical without being too \"out-there\" (unless you want it to be, of course!). the fit is true to size, and the delicate details are just lovely. Like other reviewers noted, the pics don\\'t do this skirt justice. it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors. can\\'t wait to wear this to work! Love this skirt. the detail is amazing. runs small i ordered a 12 i\\'m usually a 10, but still a little snug. Not keeping this one. the fabric is a bit tacky-looking in person, the cut is odd and it\\'s just not me. fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped, the colors are as shown and it is a good length (falls to top of hip). i simply did not like it. too metallic looking maybe... The top as with most of ap\\'s tops is well stitched. material is very uncomfortable. if you have large bust it is a little divulging. this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top! I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work. welp, that\\'s out the window. this design is poor. for one, this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i don\\'t know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his. this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2. i have no torso. so, without a jacket, i would never wear this. it\\'s very low cut..the back is very low..it\\'s a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4. This top is so much better in person. i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy. it is not and i have sensitive skin. i love this top and have got lots of compliments. This is a lovely pencil skirt that is well-made and really brightens a work day. like a lot skirts with multiple colors, a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact. So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size!! i ordered the 10 (i\\'m usually an 8 but that was sold out) and the suit arrives and doesn\\'t even fir over my hips. -- the label clearly says 10 australian us 6!  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue.  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for. I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store. when i went in again i thought i would give it a try. so glad i did ! it fits great and is way way prettier in person ! i ended up buying it and so glad i did ! This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors. i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner. it wasn\\'t as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews, however, it ran a little big. i\\'m 5.3 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6, but the six was too big. i\\'d recommend sizing down. it was also lower cut than i thought it would be....showed a lot of cleavage (i\\'m a 34d) so it\\'s not work appropriate. . Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me.  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom, i look like a clown costume.  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders.  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare.  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake, not sure if it\\'s real leather. The title says it all....this fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design. the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials (shoulder is a knit, sweater-like navy fabric) is interesting. however, that is where the positive comments end on this one. the top is so scratchy,, stiff, and, frankly, uncomfortable. i cannot imagine wanting to wear it. it could benefit from a lining, and that might have solved the problem of scratchy, itchy fabric.\\n\\nthe stiff fabric of the bo My usual size 6 fits perfectly... yes the metallic fibers on the inside are scratchy. a cami solves that problem. when ordering, i realized i cld not go strapless & wld have to wear a one of my wider strap cami\\'s in navy or black to cover the bra strap area. it was obvious some sort of cover-up swtr or jacket w/b needed & wld cover the strap area anyway. so, i also ordered the \\'faux-fur cardi\\' in the ivory to wear over this top. it\\'s a shrug-like cardi w/ 3/4 slvs. comes in the plum also if you The online picture does not do this skirt justice. it\\'s very pretty and unique in design. i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture. this is truly a pretty pencil skirt. I bought this and like other reviews, agree that the quality probably could be better, but i still love it enough to keep. the buckle fell apart, but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak. it has pilled, but the fabric is textured, so i didn\\'t even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket.  it is a perfect medium coat for 40\\'s & 50\\'s before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter.  i get compliments every time i wear it!  love!! I bought a petite, size 2. i am 5\\'3\", 111 lb - it fit perfect with a tiny bit of room. looks just like the one pictured. length on me was about 1 inch lower than the model. very bright with multiple colors. has a nice stretch. very cute. This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas. it\\'s light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out. I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception. i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasn\\'t sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online, but the print is beautiful. it\\'s a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest. i like that it has enough coverage at the top (front and back), the underarms do not fall very low, and it is lined. the a-line skirt will flatter most body types. the fabric and overall q These pants are fun! i use them as sleep pants. i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort. I ordered this in xs, i\\'m 5\\'4\", around 115lbs, and it fits perfectly. the material is very soft, but not see-through, and the romper is well-made. i wish it came in other colours, i\\'d buy more! I purchased these for something other than sweats to wear for a girls get away weekend. they were so comfortable and flattering, friends told me i could wear them out for dinner.\\n\\nthe fabric is beautiful, and i loved the way they draped. the angled cut on the legs is very cute, and something a bit different. these could be perfect for a hot summer evening dinner, because the fabric is very light and breezy. dress it up with a tank top and ballet flats and you\\'re good to go. Love this cream sleeveless top....it goes with everything and you can dress it up or down! this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater, if needed. i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length. i am 5\\'7, 34c, and overall wt. of approx. 128 lbs...it fits very nicely . thank you retailer! This skirt is beautiful (especially the color) and looks well made. however, i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me. i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasn\\'t flattering. i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this. Happy with this top- slightly thinner material than i was expecting but that\\'ll be fine with our hot summers. got the navy striped one- very pretty and extremely soft. washes well. i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra. Love the fit of this sweater! it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model. it hits me just below the hips( for ref. im 5-3\"). im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable. could be dressed up or down. runs true to size-im always a small and this fits perfectly roomy. I love this sweater!! i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesn\\'t look like a sack on me. plus, it is the perfect weight. i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable. The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess. it was overall too large, the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish, the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly. had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining, i would have liked it better. the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out. #returned Love this tunic! i am a curvy gal (with a few extra \\'curves\\' in the middle) and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative. i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy- pink, a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture. i found it true to size. typically i wear a medium or large, depending on the structure and the medium fit well. a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist. i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas, it is Loved the green color, the cut is super flattering, but alas, i do need hte petite, ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost. unfrotuantely, the color is sold out in petite :-( But i thought this was lace or with texture, it is more a pattern on regular fabric.\\n\\ncolors are nice, there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern, the fit is nice, the 0p fit snugly enough, i don\\'t think there was much give but that was comfortable enough. petite length did end below the knee as shown. i think it would have been nicer shorter but don\\'t want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behind...maybe on sale :-) I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color! the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering. i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather. i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months. the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything. i\\'m 5\\'7\" size 10-12 and the large fit just right. Beautiful color,, great quality, and great fit if you size up! i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small. i usually wear a 0/2 and i took a risk and went for the 4. it fits perfectly. i have a 25 in waist. Online, this looks like a great sweater. i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured. in fact, i\\'m pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer. unfortunately, this sweater will not work for me, as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier. I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture, but i had wishful thinking. i should have gone with my gut! this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases. it is see-through and flimsy. the bottom is just like the picture, it hangs in an odd rumpled way. the top is very flattering though, so it\\'s a shame! if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu This skirt is a great length and nice piece for fall/winter. i love the color. it fits like a high waisted skirt would which is why i purchased the next size up. This easel caftan is simply amazing! the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress. Just came today: the print is gorgeous.  very bohemian. it\\'s a dressier dress with the chiffon.  on the con side, the chiffon is very delicate, snagged easily while trying on. there\\'s raw edges on the waistband, needed trimming fresh out of the package.  sz 10 fit in the waist, too small for 36d bust; sz 12 fits bust but is big in the waist.  sz 10 ankle length for 5\\'7\", 12 hits the floor.  haven\\'t decided if i\\'ll keep the 12 and try to alter. My waist measures 28\" and the size 4 is a snug fit. i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts, but the 2 was unbearably tight. cute skirt though! i like that it\\'s machine washable, and the quality looks good. I love the fabric and color (i bought the green one). my only complaint is that the base is wider than the picture shows. it looks more fitted on the model. it is more of an a shape (significantly wider at the hips.) I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it\\'s going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it\\'s not. and because it\\'s so light, the swing effect doesn\\'t really come off. nothing special. I love the color of this skirt, and the fabric is wonderful. it was a bit longer than anticipated, but fit well. Dress ran very large in every way. beautiful design, lining and quality material. i should have sized down 2 sizes. item is now sold out. Finally a \"swing top\" that doesn\\'t look like a sack on me! i\\'ve been wanting to partake of this current style, but everything i\\'ve tried so far just looks \"dumpy\" on me. not this top -- it is very feminine and flattering. i am 5\\'7\" 118 lbs and have a small waist -- and although this is a \"swing\" style, it still shows my waist and doesn\\'t overpower me. it is also a lovely fabric -- especially in the soft pink which i got. i\\'m thinking of going back for more colors! I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it. so many people compliment it. i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up (obviously with a statement necklace too). but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down. the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink (which i hope it doesn\\'t because it is one of my favorite pieces). \\n\\nunlike the other reviewer i did not think that the Unlike the other reviewers, i did not have any problem with the sizing, fit or length of this skirt. it is a midi skirt so i think it\\'s suppose to be a little bit longer?? for me it fit true to size. for reference i am 5\\'8\", 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly. i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good. For a now feel, that comfy and well made, this was a great choice! This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great. i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it. however, on the third wear, the side zipper split wide open. needless to say, it was returned. Dang, i got a small and was still swimming in it. it\\'s made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things t-shirty- soft and thin-ish, a bit translucent. i\\'d rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering- back it went. Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost. fabric feels cheap, like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly. did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack. gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag. returned it. Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like i\\'m pregnant (not that there\\'s anything wrong with that) very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf. I loved this top; it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white; however, on this one, the chest area is too big, in both the 14 and 16, and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big. i probably need a size 12, but then i fear it would be too short-waisted on me, for i am 5\\'10\". unfortunately, it is not for me. also, the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist. i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable. the quality is ok, something i feel i would see at another type of discount store. for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus. Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges. i\\'m a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out. it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesn\\'t make the wearer look big; it falls elegantly and in a flattering way.\\n\\ngreat, versatile shirt. I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers, it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt. i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length (with my height) and amount of material became overwhelming on me. it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well. Gorgeous top, very nice. detail work, soft and flattering. i don\\'t think its too full on the bottom at all - mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette. word of warning: soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink - and definitely not my color. if peach isn\\'t flattering on you, heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly! i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade, bummer that i thought the other reviewers might Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected. it is soft to the skin and flattering. however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders. I have already worn this several times. it is very flattering, lightweight, and easy to wear. dressy but also very soft and comfortable. Very pretty fabric and beautiful color, but i agree with the other reviewer here, the fit is a bit strange. the waist is very small - need to size up at least one size for that to fit - while the rest fits nicely. it\\'s also a little longer than i had expected...sort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter (and i\\'m 5\\'11\"!). I was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress. much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos. the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated. because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love, the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance. the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine\\nappeal. while the material was not v I\\'m 5\\'4\", 130 lbs. 34 d. i bought the medium. i think i could have gotten the small but i didn\\'t have time to re-order. it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half. i love the length and the fabric.! The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it, and was mostly white, yellow and some red. the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me. the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return. Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception.  looks just like the pictures (colors/cut/drape) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck.  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff.  this dress does not stretch--the bodice felt very fitted and tight, especially at the waist band.  runs tts or small; if you\\'re busty/broad shouldered, size up.  it has a dreadful side zip, is fully lined and all synthetic fabric (boo!)  i purchased size 10p, my stats 36c/38-27-35/135#. Bought a large, could barely pull up over my butt. runs extremely small. it\\'s cute but if your not a stick figure, this is not the suit for you. Adorable... too chilly now to wear alone & too cute to cover it up! my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w/ it though. size 6 fits me perfectly & looks pretty much on me as in the pic. love plaid & cotton blend tops anyways. ruffles - adorable, & i\\'m not too big on that but do love this look. when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd \\'smoky\\'-like odor, but it\\'s the dye i think. after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared. i have in mind to wear w/ the pilcr This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess.  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable.  the dress is very fragile, handle with care. This is my new favorite top! looks and fits as described. Last minute i needed a family-friendly top for a chilly night, so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper. while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso, this has a nice a-line shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving, plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck. i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila, i am a model. just Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels. easy piece to wear many ways. great quality too. This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season. the style, with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal. i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side. won\\'t have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric! it\\'s warm without being bulky. and to top it off, it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors. this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone. extraordinary to say the least. I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that. it\\'s flattering, light weight and unique. i\\'ve received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress. i am 5\\' 6\" 150 lbs, hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium (8-10) and chose a small for this dress. i\\'d say it\\'s still loose on me- which is what i prefer. the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra. however, i\\'ve noticed i\\'m more comfortable wearing a camisole or s The inseam is advertised as 28\", but they are more like 38\". i was hoping they were for short people, but they are for someone with very long legs, event in my tallest heels, i\\'d have to get them hemmed! just a warning to my short friends out there. the quality, fit, look was great, but way way way too long. I love paige brand pants-they are soft, comfortable, and forgiving. i love these, and want them badly. the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flare-it is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like this-and paige has done a wonderful job for my body.\\n\\nmy store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length. they were significantly too long for me (5\\'3\") probably 3-4 inches to long. i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for This top is really pretty and nice quality. runs big - i went down a size, and its perfect. coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo. So i love pilcro, i wear them all the time and usually size down because they \"grow\" after wearing them. i tried on my usual size in these and felt like they are too tight, not sure if they will get any looser. the material feels really good, lightweight and the stripes are subtle but cute. not sure if i\\'ll keep them or maybe size up, This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer, or warmer climates - very fresh and airy. the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight, it is not too thin or see through. ii does not get overly wrinkled either. the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down. the v neck is just right: not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage, but deep enough to be feminine and slimming. i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses Petite pants hsould be able to fit short peple, but a 32 inch inseam on pants with buttons at the nottom, can\\'t even gegt them hemmed, what a bummer. my inseam is 27 inchess, so i would need a 5 inch heel. otherwise, gorgeous, and waiat fits true to size. thighs a bit snug for musclea, but stretchy enough to fit. thinking about keeping them, but have to find big plaform heeks... I tried on the petite size in my usual xs, adn i actually have to go down to xxs, i looked overtaken by the shirt. i\\'m 5\\'2\" and 115lbs)\\n\\ncut is flowy and not close to the body, sleeves are narrower, but still ok with athletic built.\\n\\ncolor: light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair, but for my pale self, the darker one was better... but can\\'t go wrong, i ordered both colors and liked both of them.\\n\\nruffle is a great addition too... I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them! they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino. great for hot days of summer.\\nthe subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg. overall a really flattering cut. the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top. The shirt is absolutely cute looking. but that\\'s just that....looks. i\\'m 5\\'2\" size 6 & wears m to l top. i tried on the medium in the store, it was rather flowing. i liked it. but i didn\\'t like how it fit on the underarm area. it hung very low. so i ordered a petite m. still the same. plus the store the lighting was dark so i didn\\'t realize how see through the shirt was too. had to return it. These jeans! i tried these on, in addition to the high rise paige denim, and these won out hands down. classic flattering fit from mother, with an element of edginess with the frayed hem. these are long enough on me (i\\'m 5\\'5\\') to cuff at the ankle if i don\\'t want a distressed look on a particular day. they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down. i have muscular calves and thighs, but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller.\\nit runs very generous, and so the sizing is a little off.\\nthe style and quality are beautiful, so i am anxious to receive the smaller size. The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs.\\n\\nvery comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there! I got a small mauve. the fit is great and the length is perfect for me, just few inches above my knees.\\ncute and cozy! what more can i aske for!? I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color. these are less flattering and i may not keep them. Fun detail with the beading and lace! arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected, but that\\'s the style of the piece. the fit was tts with those proportions mind.  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up, it might be a little longer in the body, but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change. the material isn\\'t too thick, so it\\'s a nice lighter layer for fall/spring. really love it! I love the style of this top, and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts. it\\'s somewhat fitted on the top yet it\\'s a-line shape gives a full swing at the bottom. the ruffled v-neckline is pretty, and i like the longer length of the short sleeves. but with all these attributes, unfortunately they cut the armholes really big, so when you put your arms forward, the sleeves pull against your arms. i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway, but for $98 dollars i thin Ordered these online and they fit perfectly. i was looking for lightweight pants for hot and humid summer days and this pair is exactly what i needed. the striped pattern is cute and adds some color. I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on. so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent. soft fabric, and for a white/lightly striped dress, not sheer. i\\'m bummed because after washing only twice (followed the instructions to wash) on gentle cycle and low tumble dry, holes started appearing everywhere, both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest, in the white part of the fabric only (it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews, but i should have ordered my own size, as they\\'re a bit loose around the waist. the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering, so i definitely recommend them! I really want to love this shirt, but the small is just way too big on me. for reference, i\\'m a 32d (which is why i didn\\'t want to size down much more than a small), 5\\'6\\' and 125 and i\\'m drowning in this. i\\'m going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality. just size down a couple of sizes!! Love pilcro, love the stripes and the length - but this particular pair of capris/crops are super tight fitting. i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight. i guess its just the cut/fabric combo. i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel ...... may work for you, however! This is exactly what i was expecting. cute, comfortable and casual. there are some gold sequins in the scroll work that i didn\\'t see online. they are super pretty in person. I tried these on in the store, and they are super cute but run small. i typically wear a size 25 (i\\'m 5\\' 5\" and 108 lbs.) and they were too tight for me. i like the fabric and the cut; i think they\\'d be great one size up. (my store didn\\'t have them.) Really nice, substantial, fully lined sweater coat. i love the structured look and the faux-leather piping around the zipper and the pockets. quality seems to be very good. it runs true to size, maybe slightly on the small side (especially for larger hips/busts) so if you are in between sizes, go up. i chose small and it\\'s just right; i wouldn\\'t be able to zip around my hips with xsmall. besides the price, which is why i dropped one star, i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat. Really pretty, but runs at least a full size small. I love these pants. i have worn them a number of times already this season. i am 5\\' so i did have to have them hemmed. i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i don\\'t think they look odd. i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps. a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks! I love this tunic the natural color is just that, this is a tunic so the fit is a little large. i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute. they seem to run just a bit small (i sized up one size from my usual) and don\\'t seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary. the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile. I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite. great comfy, casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up. highly recommend for summer! Size down! i love this item. it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth. hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some. Cute, swing top that would be flattering on most. i love the print on the white color and it\\'s so soft. doesn\\'t wrinkle easy. but it does run big! i\\'m usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it. so, size down! I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly, it fits me very well (i\\'m 5\\'2\", 34b, 26 waist, 36 hips). the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model. i like the v-neck the most because the ruffles are not too much, and it\\'s not too low cut. i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and it\\'s brighter for spring/summer. i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish. by the way, the fabric is super soft (but not w This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers; it runs very small. i\\'m typically an 8 or 10. if i get a 10, there is usually a bit of room in the item. i decided to get a 10 in this skirt, just in case. i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on. the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely. Fits well through the shoulders and arms, but there is zero waist, and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top. super cute, but have to return because of that. From the picture i wasn\\'t sure how it would fit. got in the mail and i love it. fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it. definitely should of gotten a large. I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price, and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat. the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily. other than that, the silhouette of the coat is perfect...not too boxy! it\\'s also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter. i love it! This top is very cute. got it in the lighter color. the fit is great and it will go with many things. if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also. I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail. i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesn\\'t seem to be a woman\\'s white t on the planet that isn\\'t these days, however it was really sheer. the fit was also short and boxy (this coming from a 5\\'3 woman who is short-waisted) on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute. maybe if you are younger and don\\'t mind the sheerness it\\'s worth the gambl This is a perfect jacket over any shirt, tee, or dress. jacket is well made and goes with anything! I ordered this dress in both colors. the peach color is so beautiful in person. i\\'m planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer, if i can hold off until then! definitely worth the price. This dress is incredible. i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it! i bought it in the navy color, it\\'s gorgeous in person, very bright, vibrant colors. i am 5\\'9 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist. i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out, and got it taken in a bit. i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads, if you\\'re thinking about buying this dress, do it, you won\\'t regret it! Love the look and quality of this jacket. i&amp;#39;d say it fits true to size but it is way too short for me (i&amp;#39;m just under 6&amp;#39; tall). wish these came in tall sizes! I really love the front of this shirt. however, the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it doesn\\'t seem to match the front of the shirt. i still wear it and it looks cute, but it threw me off a bit at first. Absolutely love this dress! fits true to size and makes anyone look fabulous I liked the color of this top but i didn\\'t really like the ruffled stitching around the middle. it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half. i bought this for my daughter and she likes it. i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in. Per other reviewers, i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers. it is short (cropped), but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses. I have alst year\\'s version,a dn they are essentially the smae, minus some leather parts removed... this jacket is great, the back si a little shorter, so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists (without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out). i love hte darker color, i wish it came is super dark rinse...\\n\\ni usually buy petites, but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket... i am holding myself back to order this on Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did. this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color... will have (do to the nice quality) and wear (very stylish) for a loooooong time.\\n\\na must have for the summer!!!!!! Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details. soft and not baggy. a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier. i\\'m 5\\'7\", 140 pounds with an athletic, hourglass shape, 32dd. i bought the \"2\" which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt (i\\'m normally an retailer small but i don\\'t think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted). great comfy weekend piece! I could wear this every day, it is stylish and comfortable Pretty top. love the color and the large ruffle. makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace. Love this top!\\nit is a full/ swing top, but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly.\\ni have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments.\\nlove both colors, and having fun wearing them.\\nand after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic.\\nruns true to size and in the arms slightly tight, so i went with my usual med and fits perfect.\\nif you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size, otherwise very true to size The styling of this top is really cute. it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look. my biggest complaint is the quality! it\\'s really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer. it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge, it curls really badly. i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time. not worth the $$ if paying full price. Love, love, love this dress. it is very slimming. it hugs you without really touching you. leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel. I\\'m 5\\'3 130# with a 32dd bust. i usually wear small in retailer/ cloth and stone/ running horses. the small fit me fine, but with no room for layers underneath. the small was very snug. would be perfect for california evenings. but, i live in the north east! the medium still has a great shape on me, still fitted at the waist (27inches), but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under. the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress. This dress is gorgeous!!! i love it! i bought it to wear to a july wedding. i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color. the sizing is on spot! i slipped it on and it was comfortable, easy and stylish. i am 5\\'7\" and typically xs. it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos. it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight! i am in love! This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever! it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend. the first time i wore it, i received so many compliments! I want to live in this sweatshirt. it\\'s so comfy, but also well-cut and lays nicely, not boxy at all. i\\'m typically a 10-12 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy. I liked this top even though it was a definite \\'swing\\' style. i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness.\\nlooks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look. very soft and comfortable fabric. wish it was just a little bit longer. After missing out on last year\\'s similar dress, i am so glad i finally purchased this one! it is beautiful in person. i bought to wear to a wedding, but i am curious if others think it might be too white? i bought the peach color. i will keep this dress no matter what. hope they come out with more next season! Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy. it must be pinned in the picture online. it\\'s very frustrating when they do that. thank goodness i didn\\'t pay for shipping! for reference, i\\'m 5\\'2 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs, it\\'s going back for sure. i\\'m trying to lose baby weight, not trying to look pregnant! I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance. i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket. darker color of denim with weathered edges. i absolutely love it. don\\'t let it get away. great jean jackets are hard to come by. I wanted to love this sweatshirt, but alas, it is going back. upon opening and unfolding, the first thing i noticed: the dots and not solid. they are sort of distressed looking, with parts of them missing. secondly, it doesn\\'t have a lot of structure. it\\'s soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way. it\\'s just not flattering on me. it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house. for reference, i ordered the 3, and i\\'m usually a 10/12 in tops. Love this denim jacket (also have it in white) the reason i didn\\'t give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much (none on the back which is kind of strange). i\\'d love it even more if it wasn\\'t distressed at all, then it could be dressed up much more for work. but overall it\\'s my favorite, great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy. please make this in some other denim colors! The cut is brilliant-the wash is subtle-the weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuff-and the stretch is just right. love it. the perfect staple. a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring. Love it; the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim. I love these. i\\'m between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s. they fit well. as expected. very nice fabric. good design. have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in. fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice. I\\'ve been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i\\'d prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also, it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn\\'t leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i\\'ll wait and see if this one goes on sal I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and haven\\'t found one i really liked again...until now. great quality - just heavy enough but not too heavy, just stretchy enough but not too stretchy, great color/design. no complaints. i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal. i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect. it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago, which is a big endo Beautiful colors and silhouette (i got the navy). the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk. i\\'ve gotten a ton of compliments on it. i\\'m 5\\'9\" and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee, and the low hem falls to my ankles. I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring / summer. the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tucked-in. the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color. I\\'m glad i listened to the other reviewers...i ordered a large instead of my usual medium. it\\'s roomy enough for a sweater underneath. i love the denim! it\\'s very soft and has some stretch. my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing. i also love the darker denim. I\\'m 5\\'4\" 125 lbs ordered small. fits perfect. super soft denim. love the color love the worn in feel This dress is stunning- vibrant colors and flirty feel to it. i got the small and i am a 34b/27 pants, 132 lbs- great fit. i only question two things- am i tall enough to pull off the extra fabric in the back and what the heck do you where for a bra? those two considerations are why i didn\\'t give it 5 stars. I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it! i love the darker color, more modern day less 80s. it runs a little small. i am always either a s or xs at retailer. lately, their clothes seem to be running a little bigger, so i have been an xs in most tops. when i order online, i never know which size to get. i ordered an xs, however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders. i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up, so i returned it for a s and it fits great. i was I have received so many compliments. it\\'s my favorite I wore this dress for the first time yesterday... i have never received so many compliments on a dress before! several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was!\\nit is an absolute must-have! I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape. a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants. I love this little jean jacket! i am petite and usually get a xxsp , but went for a size up. i\\'m glad i did. it fits a little snug. the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim. the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me. i love this - over maxi dresses, tanks, etc... adorable jacket - great buy!! This dress first caught my eye online. due to the price i resisted. then i saw in store and tried on...i decided to hold off for a sale, but my will was getting thin. once i saw it start to sell out online, i had to take the plunge. i knew this dress was a must have. it is super flattering and comfy! the best of both worlds. i\\'m small-chested so both the s and m fit, but the seam on the s fit a bit higher, which was more flattering on me, so s is what i got. it can be dressed up or slightly down I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don\\'t live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs, 5\\'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on, they just don\\'t look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a First i ordered a m. i\\'m normally a 8-10. the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg. the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole. i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition. hopefully i will make it to the store soon (there are none w/in an hour of me) and look before i buy. I purchased the navy color of this dress. not only did it look good, but felt good as well. since it is for a wedding, i also purchased a white crochet cropped \"sweater\" to wear over as well, making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom. could not have been happier. This top looks pretty much like it does not the model. the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight. the fabric is light weight, but not see-through. it does not wrinkle a lot. i\\'ve gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too. the v-neck is pretty deep, but doesn\\'t show so much cleavage that you couldn\\'t wear it to work. Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace. also runs very large, i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso. very unflattering cut! I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it. i found it to be pretty true to size, even after washing. it\\'s a little sheer, so you\\'d definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work. it\\'s a great top for spring/summer! I thought this top was adorable in the store and online. it just didn\\'t work for me. although it fit, it flares out too much in the front and just wasn\\'t flattering on me. i am 5\\' 5\" and 128 lbs. and ordered the small. Love this top! made with 100% cotton, a vintage look, and flattering details this top is a winner for me. i think it fits true to size (got my regular size 0) and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short (5\\'3\"). it is somewhat see through, but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work, i think it can be worn without a cami. the perfect lightweight, comfortable, standout piece for the summer time :) I really like this blouse a lot. very very easy to wear!! i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend. very flattering and great blue color!!! very happy with this purchase. highly recommend. i am 5\\'6\" short torso and my usual 6 worked. I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it! i almost always wear a size small at retailer (34d-27-35) and the fit and length are both perfect on me. if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size. i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there. what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations. i didn\\'t know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm. haven\\'t worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items. i\\'m usually an extra-small but the xxs also fits. it\\'s a great buy especially since it\\'s on sale now. This is an awesome vest - so soft, cozy, and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter. for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did, i\\'ll mention the one flaw...no pockets :( still totally worth full price in my mind though. I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small. i\\'m usually an 8 but needed this in a 10. this shirt is reallly just perfect. great sleeve length. just the right amount of v neck. beautiful pattern with a vintage feel. i love the combo of stripes, polka dots and sweet flowers. This blouse is so pretty. i love the long tie. the pattern is very unique. it is a thin, light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket. This is a beautiful blouse...sheer and feminine. i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual. it is a full top...can\\'t tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms. so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size. this is supposed to be a full, shorter fit...i would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b The photo of these is truly misleading - they are a beautiful vibrant print - see the close-up photo. they are much longer on a regular person - they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 5\\'5\"there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each (like a pleat) that really allows a nice flow. these look great with boots, flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large. not lined, but drape beautifully. there are pockets (sewn closed upon purchase) and pack pockets. Like another reviewer mentioned, this shirt is way too short. i\\'m only 5\\'2\" (xs) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model. also, the quality isn\\'t great as it\\'s very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front. it\\'s a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique. sadly, it\\'s going back! I didn\\'t think anything of this top online (i really don\\'t care for how they styled it) but in store it was more interesting. i\\'m currently anywhere between a 2-4-6 / xs-s-m, depending on the style, 5\\'3\" 120lb 34b. size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly. for some reason, on me, the sleeves were elongating and flattering (closer to my elbow) and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model, the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but, due to the color and p Nice fabric and cute design. a little low cut. I absolutely love this sweater!! it\\'s soft, easy to wash, and looks great! The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern. a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering. very happy with this purchase. i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish. I had high hopes for this top. really boxy, short This dress has potential, but it didn\\'t work for me. it runs true to size to a little big, i ordered medium, my usual size for maeve). as for length it fit me as the model (5\\'9\"). the reason i\\'m not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit, I love this tee! the material is thick but not too thick. it\\'s highly flattering- i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings. the shimmer on the front adds something special. I got this top in the black and i love it. the bottom is a silky material that\\'s really beautiful, and the cutout details are really pretty. so many of retailer\\'s sweaters are enormous, but this one fits tts. \\n\\nmy one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily. This top was way too short (i\\'m only 5\\'1) and way too wide. the cut of this top was so wide, it looked like a tent on me. i really wanted to love this top because the material and style (sleeves, ruffle) are beautiful, unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut. i\\'ve have several blouses made by one fine day, which fit nicely, for some reason this top did not. i ordered in my usual s size, even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong. My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store. this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture. it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter. This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter. it\\'s versatile- i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs! there\\'s so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use! just as an fyi, the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them. this may not even be noticeable if you\\'re not looking right up close. for me, this adds to the unique quality I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person! the description didn\\'t give as much information as i wanted so i\\'m going to be very detailed in this review. i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose (two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time), and i\\'ll have to hand sew others on more tightly. my usual size is a pxs or p0, and there were no petite sizes available. however the size 0 fits perfectly, no alterations need When i received this blouse, ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky. some of the fabric would stick to these dots. i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid. however, after hanging on my closet door, the dots are still sticky. i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me. Wasn\\'t sure about this top based on reviews, but glad i purchased! pretty print, looks great with denim. very loose, flowy top. hangs a little short, but that\\'s the style of this blouse. fit true to size. i usually wear a 2/4 and xs/sm with 30dd. size small worked for me. Ordered the shirt online. beautiful print and good quality material. runs very large - size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide. i will be exchanging it in the store. This too is so beautiful in person. there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming. i love this top with business attire and denim. fits tts. I tried this in the store and i like it - nice and soft, good basic design that will pair with many pieces. but i decided to wait because of the price. i\\'m sure i would get a lot of use out of this top, but ultimately it didn\\'t thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase. i bought a sweater that was on sale instead. still, a very nice top. i may buy it eventually, especially if it goes on sale. Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom. i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out. this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars. I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store. it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering. the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group. it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely. it is a soft, soft fabric, almost fleece-like but not plush. I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely. i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office. the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out. really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal! I am 5.6\", 138 pounds. i purchased this in a size small. it is flowy and not too short. it has a comfortable, but still feminine and beautiful fit. one of my favorite new blouses...the red print is gorgeous This top light and airy, which is perfect for spring. i\\'m usually into these types of blouses; however, this didn\\'t quite fit right on me. it\\'s a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason. i loved the design and really wanted to like it... i just didn\\'t love it enough to purchase it. This blouse is so beautiful - the collar, sleeves, material...everything except the cut! it was like a tent. it needed to be more tapered, which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow, and be about two inches longer.\\n\\ni had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed! please fix it and then i will buy again. i am 5\\'4\", 140lbs and busty...a small was perfect, with the exception of the massive amount of material. Very pretty blouse. i love the print, and color of the pink floral. tts, i ordered the xs, because of the roomy cut of the blouse. i\\'m 5\\'8\", 117 lbs. it fit great. the cut is a little wider then pictured, but still cute. not to short as mentioned by another review, and i have a longer torso, i wasn\\'t crazy about the victorian collar, so tucked it under, and it looks great! I normally wear a large or extra-large; the medium is still very billowy on me. this blouse is ethereal and lovely, though - pretty and funky at the same time. it\\'s sheer but somehow not revealing. perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer. Not a coat by any means, merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining ---and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on. the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isn\\'t pretty enough for a spring coat..sizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated. I saw this in-store, tried it on, and was sold. it is not just super soft but very flattering on. i am petite, 105 lbs and bought the xs in black- the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed. i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans. Love this. it\\'s heavy/warm, stylish and a great throw on any outfit. oversized style. The fabric was nothing special (i usually like a cotton/silk blend woven fabric, but this was stiff feeling) and the pattern was cute. but what made me return it was the fact that 1) the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint. literally. puffy. paint. and 2) the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived. parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it. i could barely unfold it.\\n\\ni\\'m sure this could have been cute, but who wants a top that looks lik Tts. i\\'m wearing a small. the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants. washed nicely. layers flat to dry. had to iron the shell underneath. great for casual office. This top is good quality and cute. it runs large- i\\'m usually a medium and needed a small. the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on. it makes me look wide in the waist or like i\\'m wearing a maternity top. unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it. I\\'m a pretty solid 10/12 in this brand. i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run small...and i agree. while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear, it\\'s tight in the shoulders and chest. for the record, those are 2 areas i never have problems with. i\\'m a 36b and it was flattening my chest. it was also quite short on me. i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button. the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12. I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester (poly/rayon blend) in it and i don\\'t like polyester; still, i couldn\\'t pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat. it\\'s like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing! it\\'s a little on the pricey side. since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat, i would have liked the price better if it was $100 less. it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on. i I like this sleeveless sweater - it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk. paired with black/white patterns it\\'s pretty versatile (as seen in the pics) - a great staple for a more casual office environment. being a taller girl i love the length on it, and find it\\'s flattering for my curvy figure. This blouse is super cute but oddly sized. i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust. the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage, so this had to go back. i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer, i just couldn\\'t make it work\\n. I love the sweatshirt \\n clay color is very different it\\'s a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges \\n although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite\\n great light sweatshirt for spring and summer Love the patterns and the length.  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets. \\nit\\'s really a special piece and on sale, very worth it! Very comfy and light. can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt. I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it. i am either an xs or s in antho, and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy. normally i would have overlooked this shirt as it\\'s rather unimpressive on the hanger, but it was on sale so i tried it on. very cute when tried on! it fits well across the shoulders but isn\\'t too clingy in the body, which i like. the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews. i am tall and have a long torso, so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering? maybe if your taller it hangs better? i have to say... i love everything about it. it is a fantastic print, it is very flowy but i don\\'t think it\\'s too much in that regard. i think it is fitting with the romantic, girly style of the garment. in my opinion not too short, just right. i took a medium, i am 5\\'8\" and athletic. I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite. unfortunately the fabric was stiff, it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there. returned. All the rave reviews are true!  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it. i\\'m having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this. this is a great three season layering piece and i\\'m thrilled i was able to get it on sale.  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection. I love this top. i got it on sale and am so glad that i did. it is a short too but still super flattering. it isn\\'t too boxy on me. I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xs/s. although it\\'s wool i didn\\'t notice that is was itchy & usually wool bothers me. i am of small build but i did like the long & oversized look. i admit i am drawn to the print anyways. i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xs/s - it was the same. probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes. i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xs/s in a few wks since the invent This has great drape, length, the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints. i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck, so not sure if i will keep, though i don\\'t seem to want to take it off! has a lightweight, boiled wool texture, contrasting print and design so cool! I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person, and it was love at first sight. the black and white makes it versatile, and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward. more importantly, the pattern is cleverly designed which doesn\\'t compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern (as shown on model). i purchased the regular xs/s and it fit me fine (i\\'m 5\\'2\", 34b, 26 waist, and 36 hips) and the hem falls about two inches below my knees. the Surprisingly flattering on, especially with pants/jeans. extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws: the pleating enhances the bust, the v-cut provides a touch of a peekaboo (not enough to show cleavage but it\\'s there in a super flattering way), the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more; the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office, under a jacket, or just plain for going out. the material is not too thick but not The top runs small, it is a very sexy and slimming top. i tried in l, it was too small so i have ordered it in xl. i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this. but it is a very sexy, good looking, and slimming top. i love it!! I was looking for a basic tee, but this one was just ok...the quality is okay, but it us not as soft as i would have liked. unfortunately,  i will be returning this item. An excellent going out to dinner, to a lounge, etc. piece. super flattering, sexy, feminine and trendy! can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories. i\\'m only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits, but this was excellent! I would\\'ve looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on. the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy. i\\'m usually a m but went with the s b/c it looked better fitted. this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy. i can\\'t wait to wear. would look great with white jeans! This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it. it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness . i like everything about it! I\\'ve been looking for the perfect work-appropriate lace dress (for a casual/creative work environment) for a while, and this was just the ticket! the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace. i rolled the sleeves to a short-sleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more (although the sleeves, worn long, are absolutely gorgeous!). the lace isn\\'t exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used, but pretty nonetheless. i\\'m 5\\'5 /125 and th Disappointed in the quality of the dress. love the style and especially the colors. the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made. the top bodice is more substantial. not worth the price tag of $148.00. dress does run short. Comfy cozy and a bit on the big size, even for an oversized piece. order a size down, even if you want a boxier look. unsure how the fabric will hold up-but if it does it will be a great get. This dress is not what i expected. the bottom half is wool-like material-looks like someone has worn it. the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry. when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms. i wouldn\\'t of paid full price but for the amount, i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter. I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large - so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly. love the length- it hits mid hip. it is more of an a-line than straight as show in the picture. the detail is fun and the sweater is well made. highly recommend it- i have received lots of compliments on this sweater. I love this top, it\\'s design is very pretty and like nothing that i have. i think this top runs true to size, i\\'m usually an xs/s in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great. i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily, so while wearing it you have to be very careful!! This skirt is very short. i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle. that\\'s quite off because i\\'m only 5 feet tall, and i wore it pretty low on the hips. it also flares out awkwardly below the knee. there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem. i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt. plus, the fabric--while thick and beautiful and stretchy--has a This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it - love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful. the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight, so definitely appropriate for winter, fall, and cooler spring days. i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot - it was wider down the torso and a little shorter (not tunic length like picture). i\\'m 5\\'7\" with a longer torso and this hit maybe mid-bum and I really like the appearance of this item, and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings. it does run a little large. i am a \"true to size\" small, and this hangs on me a little, but i love the design of the back. it is so soft and comfortable! I don\\'t normally review my purchases, but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made, i couldn\\'t help myself but to post a review. the neck line isn\\'t even hemmed down so it flaps up. the material is thin and feel cheap. this dress isnt even worth $20 in my opinion. i was expecting a well made, good quality dress for the high price tag. Ordered this dress online, and i love it! i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for. the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist, but for the most part, the dress fit very well and was very flattering, may just need a little bit of ironing. i am 5\\'9 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips, and I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear. however, after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing, so i tried it on. what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person, and very soft and warm. it\\'s a perfect winter sweater to start the new year. i am 5\\'-7\", 138 lbs. and the medium fit perfectly, though it\\'s a little shorter on me than shown in the photos. If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can\\'t fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing, but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day. Like the reviewers before me, this dress runs small in the rib cage. i normally take a 12 and am a 32b. the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12. it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top. there is no wiggle room in the dress. \\n\\nthat being said, it is a really cute style and shape - rather like a 50\\'s style dress if you will with a sexy back. i am curvy on the bottom and this dress hides the flaws there for sure. however, because it is a fulle I should have exchanged it for a smaller size, but i wanted to wear it, so my mistake. i tend to wear size 12-14, and the large is entirely too big. it also had piling right out of the bag. but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway. if you get this, size down for sure. I\\'m surprised other reviewers loved this one so much. it\\'s completely different then how it looks on the model. it\\'s much shorter, which others do mention, but it flares a lot. enough to feel maternity-ish on me. it looks fitted on the model. maybe it\\'s my shape, i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips. i ordered an xs too. i will say the material\\nis very nice and it\\'s well made, but it\\'s going back. This sweater is fine for the casual days. i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old. i\\'m a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them. this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears. very soft, but poor material. not my favorite purchase. Great fit! no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size. very cute! for reference, i&#39;m 5&#39;2, 115 lbs and take a 26p. they look just like they do on the model. i highly recommend! Just tried \\'layered sadie top\\' and it felt so nice on. good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed. this item is definitely \"vanity-sized\". i\\'m 5\\'1, 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model. it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternity-esque. highly recommend because it\\'s gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you I\\'m 5\\'4\\'\\', between sizes 12 and 14. i ordered a size petite large, and it\\'s a bit loose, which is acceptable, but i\\'d like to try a regular size medium to see if it\\'d be more fitted like i see in the model.\\nmy problem is with the length. i read the description and it says petite = 40.5\\'\\' of length. the large petite i ordered is above my knees, this is not 40\\'\\' of length by any means, it\\'s 36.5\\'\\'.\\ni\\'d really appreciate if the size info was correctly available. This is a great long sleeve, casual shirt for spring - soft and airy. pairs well with jeans. i found that it fit me just right. i\\'m not very tall, but my shoulders are a little broad for my height, which typically puts me in the \"small/medium\" range, so i got size 6 regular. this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on. very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust. gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel. my only problem is there aren I... love... this dress. the fit is incredibly flattering (and i\\'m currently carrying more weight than my normal size). i selected a 6, which is about a size larger than normal, and it was a perfect fit. i tried on a larger size for measure, and the 6 provided a (perfect) fit and flare. i\\'ve worn the dress on three occasions, already, and each time friends remarked on their admiration for the dress, itself and flattering style for me, i have no issues, at all, with the cut, and to me, the bias a This top is very light weight and comfortable. i am normally a 8/10 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews. it fits great. i really like the fit and the pattern. it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie. This is a precious! it\\'s a little thin, as i prefer a thicker fabric. however, wearing a tank top under it works perfectly. i have it now in both colors! great price on sale! I got this shirt in red plaid and love it. super cute without being too trendy. i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments. I originally purchased this dress in a petite 6. i am 5\\'3\", 125lbs with a 36\" bust. the petite 6 was a bit too tight so i returned it and went up to a size 8. so happy i did! this dress drapes and flows beautifully and i find it immensely flattering to my hourglass figure. i also adore the floral print! one reviewer objected to the way the bodice drapes and the very small hook closure which seemed insufficient. i did not object to this characteristic. it fit me beautifully throughout the bodice/ This is not usually a top that i am attracted to, but it is so cute paired with jeans and sandals. nice, light-weight top for summer. I\\'m petite, and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater - that is the look that is portrayed on the model. the sweater is scratchy, the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right. it looks great on the model here, but not on me. going back. so bummed. the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little \"holes\" or openings across the shoulders. so there is a tiny bit of detail. overall, not a great sweater. I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for spring/summer. for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses. the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all. the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown. this dress has no shape to it, although probably comfortable, not flattering. i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture, in person. This dress is very flattering, comfortable and made me feel pretty! I love this dress but it definitely runs big. i bought a size small and i\\'m between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs. the top feels like it will fall down and i\\'m a size 34c So soft!! such beautiful fabric!! it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured. one of my favorite retailer purchases to date... This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips. the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug, and i\\'m relatively slim in the hips. I bought this sweater because i love twinkle\\'s knitting patterns and yarns. this sweater doesn\\'t disappoint. i love all of the great details like the detachable collar, the double buttons along the front and the back panel is in a seed stitch (which differs from the front and sleeve stitch). it\\'s super warm and cozy but it\\'s also very heavy. depending on the temp outside, i can wear this as a coat. but i think the sweater will stretch over time because it\\'s so heavy. Love the look! it\\'s a little tight but i still like it.'"

       "'Absolutely wonderful  silky and sexy and comfortable Love this dress  its sooo pretty  i happened to find it in a store and im glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc its petite  i bought a petite and am 58  i love the length on me hits just a little below the knee  would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me i initially ordered the petite small my usual size but i found this to be outrageously small so small in fact that i could not zip it up i reordered it in petite medium which was just ok overall the top half was comfortable and fit nicely but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap net over layers imo a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper  it c I love love love this jumpsuit its fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan love this shirt I love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me i returned this dress I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person store pick up i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale  hte color is really gorgeous and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size bummer no petite i decided to jkeep it though because as i said it matvehd everything my ejans pants and the 3 skirts i waas trying on of which i kept all  oops I ordered this in carbon for store pick up and had a ton of stuff as always to try on and used this top to pair skirts and pants everything went with it the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer and went well with pencil skirts flare pants etc my only compaint is it is a bit big sleeves are long and it doesnt go in petite also a bit loose for me but no xxs so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size I love this dress i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style Im 55 and 125 lbs i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasnt too long i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses if youre less busty 34b cup or smaller a s petite will fit you perfectly snug but not tight i love that i could dress it up for a party or down for work i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year needless to say it will be going back This dress is perfection so pretty and flattering More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past they are right on in their estimation of the product in the case of this dressif it had not been for the reveiwsi doubt i would have even tried this the dress is beautifully made lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality it is lined in the solid periwinklecolored fabric that matches the outer fabric print tts and very formfitting falls just above the knee and does not rid Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didnt bother lining the skirt portion grrrrrrrrrrr\\nmy stats are 34a282936 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half so i would say its running big\\nthe straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too\\nim 56 and it came to just below my knees This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings the size small fit me well  i am usually a size 24 with a small bust in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up but then perhaps the waist will be too big the problem with this dress is the quality the fabrics are terrible the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldnt these are for an hourglass figure i am more straight up and down the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips  for me that said they are really nice sturdy linenlike fabric pretty color well made i hope they make someone very happy Material and color is nice  the leg opening is very large  i am 51 100 and the length hits me right above my ankle  with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle and front pleats to make me fluffy i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look  if you are at least average height or taller this may look good on you Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did i wasnt crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly crisp and clean is how i would describe it launders well fits great drape is perfect wear tucked in or out  cant go wrong A flattering super cozy coat  will work well for cold dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit  i am 5 5 about 135 and the small fits great I love the look and feel of this tulle dress i was looking for something different but not over the top for new years eve im small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look once i steamed the tulle it was perfect i ordered an xsp length was perfect too If this product was in petite i would get the petite the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that \\n\\nfits nicely im 54 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into \\n\\nthe tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting Im upset because for the price of the dress i thought it was embroidered no that is a print on the fabric i think i cried a little when i opened the box it is still ver pretty i would say it is true to size it is a tad bit big on me but i am very tiny but i can still get away with it the color is vibrant the style is unique skirt portion is pretty poofy i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price although the quality is definitely there except i wish it were emb First of all this is not pullover styling there is a side zipper i wouldnt have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me\\n\\nsecond of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath\\n\\nnot at all what is looks like or is described as sadly will be returning but im sure i will find something to exchange it for Cute little dress fits tts it is a little high waisted good length for my 59 height i like the dress im just not in love with it i dont think it looks or feels cheap it appears just as pictured I love this shirt because when i first saw it i wasnt sure if it was a shirt or dress since it is seethrough if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings i bought a slip wore the tie in the back and rocked it with white wedges you could also wear it as a vest be careful with the buttons i havent had any fall off yet but i feel like they will overall its great for any occasion and its fun to wear Loved the material but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium im 55 and there was atleast 5 of material at my feet the gaps in the front are much wider than they look felt like the dress just fell flat both were returned im usually a large and the med fit better 36d 30 in jeans I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat the sleeves are very wide although long as a light weight fall coat the sleeves dont need to be as wide because you wouldnt be layerng too much underneath the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh The colors werent what i expected either the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldnt find anything to really go with it fabric is thick and good quality has nice weight and movement to it the skirt just wasnt for me in the end I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated dont hesitate buy this shirt you wont be sorry This sweater is so comfy and classic  it balances a quirky handknit look with a beautiful color and practical fit it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style and as others mentioned there are gaps in the knit that make it seethrough in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering i like having a longer camisole showing underneath or wearing it over a little dress its warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these I never would have given these pants a second look online in person they are much cuter the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend this brand has always run small for me i am 58 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer These pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned I ordered this 3 months ago and it finally came off back order a huge disappointment the fit wasn39t so much the issue for me the quality of the wool is subpar someone else mentioned a quotfelted woolquoti guess is that what you call it  it does literally feel like felt super thin itchy doesn39t drape very well and feels cheap made in china i got it on sale but still not worth what i paid definitely going back This is such a neat dress the color is great and the fabric is super soft i am tall so the long length was an added bonus it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps i am going to pair it with a funky tank top necklaces and boots super cute Wouldnt have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily while not the most exciting design it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops Just ordered this in a small for me 56 135 size 4 and medium for my mom 53 130 size 8 and it is gorgeous  beautifully draped all the weightwarmth ill need for houston fall and winter looks polished snapped or unsnapped ageappropriate for both my mom 60s and myself 30s will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings we ordered the gray which is true to the photos Super cute and comfy pull over sizing is accurate material has a little bit of stretch Great casual top with flare looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans flattering with peplum in back nice cut for shoulders and neckline Pretty and unique great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels the colors print and embroidery are lovely reasonably priced This is a beautiful top its unique and not so ordinary i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest although i had a baby this year and i am nursing so that could be why if i bought again i would size up This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design the colors look like sorbet  cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring great buy First this is thermal so naturally i didnt expect super sheer but it is really sheer light fabric i like it but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it second it is large i ordered the size 0 and its a nice oversized fit for my 53 125 pounds i wouldnt want to go larger along with being sheer the fabric is easily stretched which i dont mind in this case finally the color it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it it is so comfortable and flattering its too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you cant see the ruching across the front a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer 58 and i generally wear a 6 the small fit well will probably be back for the black I bought this item from online the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight so i took it back to the store  ordered a larger size for the sale price this is a great top I love this top i wear it all the time  the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade  id still recommend it as it is so comfortable Very comfortable material is good cut out on sleeves flattering This sweater is perfect for fallits roomy warm super comfy and the color really pops Really cute top the embroidery on the collar  bib of this top is beautiful and unique received lots of compliments  questions about where i got it im rather busty up top and the medium fit well a small probably wouldve fit better but its still super adorable This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall it fits well nice print and its comfortable i tried this on in the store but did not purchase it because the color washed me out this is not the best color for a blonde would look much better on a brunette if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it I absolutely love this bib tee its probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time im 57 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me i typically wear either a s or m tops Love the color and style but material snags easily Very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment the model is positioned so that you cant see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam i actually like the seam  it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done  there are two layers that form the cowl and ive found that it means wardrobe malfun Nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman im picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didnt look great on me theres a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely its a lightweight tee fabric thats opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable i dont usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra its soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it its comfortable so thats a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it I got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didnt have to have it altered in the length can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline its a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th Ive been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not bindingtight for night time and casual wear this is a light weight bra could be a little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back  itchy i need to remove it This dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i cant wait to wear it size small worked for me and since im tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail 3 tags sewn in 2 small about 1 long and 1 huge about 2 x 3 very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags not comfortable at all also  i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup  so for me this would only be a lounging bralette  if it wasnt so itchy I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list im so happy with it its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso 53 the pattern on the front is very flattering Very comfortable shirt light weight top with lovely floral colors great for springsummer with white jeans love everything one september makes Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale Beautiful top but delicate i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling other than that it is beautiful and vibrant just make sure you arent doingwearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate Just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten im usually a l but sometimes im a xl if no stretch in retailer tops i bought this one in l and im sure glad i did very flowy stretchy and comfortable i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a tshirt and the other is more of a blouse i almost think i couldve gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me Love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item I really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets This top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped a line which is not apparent from the pictures i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42 and sweep is over 70 i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking im thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style Why do designers keep making crop tops i cant imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4 tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s I have a short torso and this works well for me 34c bought the 0 theres not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesnt hang and have extra fabric like on the model \\n\\nzipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so its easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric\\n\\nunlike another reviewer i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer wi I love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you dont need a cami it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit 1 criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only 52 so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am 32c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it cannot be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it very disappointing since i love the design im actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that its come to that I usually size up with this brand small was perfect for me at 135lbs this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms This dress is adorable  its a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining though still overpriced in my opinion the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine 57 128 where this gets me is the fact that its dry cleantotally doesnt make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot  I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit im 51 112lbs so dress hit rt below knee will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming\\n\\nthis dress looks stunning on great vibrant color  i have dark hair makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish when i tried it on in store salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it i did and am glad\\n\\ni plan to wear it this spring for my daughte Loved this top great design comfortable and unique soft material The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket the print is great i love it its so different than any other jackets ive seen while the jacket is ã¼ber cute it is a bit bulky though the waist tie helps with that and its not heavy winter appropriate  its not waterproof or heavily insulated for your average winter day though it will be a fun option the removable v I purchased this top in an antro store last week the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders but can be removed by snaps i tooks great when worn two different ways i wore it with the campole out and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom it also looks great when the camisole is worn in my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as its a touch big at the shoulders and neckli I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly im not crazy in love with it but i also dont dislike the shirt is on the thin side do i need to wear a cami underneath it no my concern is holes it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes with that being said ill wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing the length is fine and i do like the slits in frontit adds a little dim I was really hoping to like this but it did not look the way it does on the model at least not on me the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back i am 58 and usually wear a medium or large i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows it made me look bigger and was not flattering material has a nice weave but its thin and delicate i bought the holly deep olive and the blue colors I tried this on from the sale section and they only had a 2 i usually do 0 and surprisingly that size was the right fit it is fitted with just enough room to eat  \\nte blue is a light blue almost neutral with the white embroidery i think it looked stylish and decided to keep it the peplum part hit just in the right spot i am short petite but my torso is normal size I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model but if i was to tighten it it looks a lot more flattering i tried on the xs in the store i usually do that to decide if i need petite and it looked huge when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work it was a lot of fabric and looser didnt look as good on me but i like the dress overall so still recommend and for those who like the looser look this is great i would however order eptite for 515 115 lbs 03 dd che Really cute piece but its huge i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering returning I bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it when i tried it on the fit was fine but it just lackedsomething the back was a little bit too long the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after gorgeous fabric and top but not for me i wanted something more for 150 bought the velvet tunic instead  I love cute summer dresses and this one especially because it is made out of linen is unique it is very wellmade with a design that is quite flattering i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10 it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give the perfect dress to wear to italy or france now i just have to book my tickets This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model the pattern and texture are both lovely and the peplum is surprisingly flattering it is definitely on the short side but i think that gives it a modern look the fabric does not stretch at all but i still think it fits tts if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size but otherwise i would order your normal size This shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was i love the shape design and and the color its perfect for spring and summer with some white pants unfortunately i dont see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way so far it doesnt work with any of my jeans skirts or shorts i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits so im still on the fence if im going to keep it or not with that aside it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful Purchased this top online and when i received it was very pleased\\nit has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric\\nlove that the sleeves run longerads to the overall look\\nalso loved the v necklineenhances the feel of the overall style\\nwith various necklaces this top has limitless options\\nthe color states mosswhich i usually think of as greenish browni found it to be more of a taupe\\nwould have liked it to have a green tones however it is still a fantastic f I usually wear a medium and bought a small it fit ok but had no shape and was not flattering i love baby doll dresses and tops but this was a tent my daughter saw me try it on and said thats a piece of tablecloth its going back I was very excited to order this top in red xs so cute but it was huge shapeless and support thin it had to go back i shouldve looked at other reviews I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons when i received it it looked exactly as it does in the picture online however the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day its definitely a comfortable shirt but it felt more like a pajama top its going back At first i wasnt sure about it the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought but after wearing it it really is comfortable it stretches a lot so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward im not showing the world my torso I find that this brand can be a little bit allovertheplace with sizes had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well i bought a m in another shirt from them the seamed scoop neck and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this just something to keep in mind still a great shirt love the neutral color This top is absolutely stunning i purchased the white one just received and it fits nicelya little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way this will look great with everything it is well constructed and looks very unique love it The fabric felt cheap and i didnt find it to be a flattering top for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 383040 Runs big and looked unflattering i am petite might work on someone taller I bought this lovely silkvelvet shirt in the quotskyquot color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue which disappointed me it is definitely darker than appears in photo still a luxurious wellmade beauty with sassy appeal it drapes like a snake slithering down your body it comes with attitude Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt  and the color sky is gorgeous  but as another reviewer saidit runs small  it was also way too short  so sadly i will be returning this  i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great qualityit just didnt fit me I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if youre well endowed its a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs havent decided about keeping it because it looks oversized but cozy and its really long it almost touches the top of my knees in back sooooo pretty though The shirt is exactly as it is pictured i have the burnt orange color and love it i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt it fits true to size as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders i would give this top a 55 Perfect dress for hot humid sticky weather This is so thin and poor quality especially for the price it felt like a thin pajama top the buttons are terrible little shell buttons this could not have been returned faster I didnt end up keeping this dressit just wasnt right for me it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin partially lined which is a plus and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slitvent was just too high for my liking the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 54 118 i guess i just didnt love it and would rather save my funds for something i ca I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small i have to totally disagree with the reviewer i find that this top runs true to size or even generous the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit 52 broad shoulders 120 lb This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time it runs true to size im 51 113 lbs and got the xs petite wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it The designshape of the dress are quite flattering flirty and feminine but there is no way that the dress i received is new the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area there is no tag the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp stiff or new i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received undoubtedly this one is going back\\n\\ndear retailer  please make sure that you do not send preowend clothing articles to This one totally worked for me love the color length and style Prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress it definitely needs heels im 54 120 34d and this is a size 36 i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff This is the perfect summer dress it can be dressed up or down the quality of the linen fabric is very nice im 51 and it hit right below my knees i found it to run true to size those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size but the tie in the front can be adjusted its lovely First the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer i really wanted to like this top but the fitting is so awkward for me i typically where a 0xs and sized up in the shirt to a size 2 it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest size 32a i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow need a strapless bra and made it look unflattering overall had to return this one back to the store The color is perfect for fall and into winter only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining the lining was an unexpected bonus and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up\\nthe fit is true to size and the stressed velvet fabric is current for this season\\nim going to enjoy wearing this shirt The perfect striped tshirt and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different i love it Great look and you can wear this vest with almost everything  i normally wear a small but they only had mediums and it fit fine i like it tied this will stay in my closet all year round  it does look like it will wrinkle easily but that doesnt bother me  a must buy  This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work to a bbq or to happy hour i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model After reading the previous reviews i ordered a size larger i am so glad i did it it fits perfectly i am 5411532dd and went with the s regular so beautiful i cant wait to wear it I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral unfortunately the shape is a line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering so it will be returned Like others reviewers mentioned on here this dress is extremely well made but there were too many cons for me as well this would most certainly work on a petiteshorter frame but for tall busty and curvier girls it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out\\n\\nhowever im a 36c and found that the armshoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top there was entirel I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated however they are sadly very true let me be clear that this is a beautiful comfortable piece of clothing when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality and while the pattern is interesting and pretty the dark orange color i was expecting is actually a mud brown i think its unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket but i digress the This coat is beautiful i love the color and the design it definitely runs a little large i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already the vest keeps it warm but the sleeves arent lined so its cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if youre going to be in cold weather Nice vest pretty olive color hangs nice butits just kinda funny just hangs and really looks odd when tied i like the laying piece just wished it had more umph This top is super comfy and casual the slitdesign in the front gives it more of a stylish look than your average white long sleeve tee would definitely recommend Intrepid soul that i am i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes shook it out hung it up and it is just the same as when it went in doesnt need to be ironed and didnt shrink yes the swing is vast but that is part of its charm pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything i think it is fun something i will use for years wonderfully comfort Its ok fit doesnt wow me because of my body chest is too wide hips look too narrow drapes across my back fat in an especially nonflattering way basically made my squareapple body look more squareapple great part about this dress is that its comfy and hides the tummy pooch construction is poorly donecontrasting liner at vneck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally another negative point is dry clean only boo im 53 140 392835 an In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section and it really has more of a jammie top feel soft thin and stretchy its super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice mine seems to have stretched out a little especially the neckline and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed im happy with it though for what it is  a great casual day t I love this vest there are so many ways to style itopen or tied closed over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans i get compliments every time i wear it its soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavyhot to wear all day This blouse is a perfect creation perfectweight cotton many many details and color all perfectly executed theres fullness to the body so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot humid locations this summer and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look theres no mistaking quality when you look at this piece i bought the medium for my 130 34f size 8 blousetee frame this is the blouse you will have for years and you will enjoy Love this vest the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really isits a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants a great piece for polished but casual style and the fabric has a nice soft suedelike finish\\n\\nif only the was slightly higher to hit my true natural waist it would get that fifth star but sometimes i wear petite sizes so that might be the issue herestill looks good tied I received the sky color in m online  am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful  however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long  i am 5 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short  i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot  but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering i was excited for this to arrive this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall the fabric is decent and the weigh The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering classic and comfortable the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile  could be worn yearround so long as its not 100 degrees out  there is a bit of weight to it its one of my favorite pieces in my closet can be styled 20 different ways pair with a higherend tee tank denim jacket or bodyhugging sweater i sized down Perfect for work or going out i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate it did not feel scratchy to me maybe because i layered it great buy especially with the discounts feel like i lucked out Its a pretty top but it runs very short the back is also pretty see through so im not sure i will keep it its called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder great design just not sure i will keep it due to length Iim not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it looks good dressed up wa nice top or casual wa tee can be worn practically all year love it My firned tried this on and her first comment was take it off it is scratchy so i didnt bother trying it on it is however beautiful if you are not sensitive to scratchy material\\nfit was true to size The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders but that was kind of snug perhaps why it didnt fit right it is not off the shoulders on this picture the cut is loose so it looked big on me but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on may give it another try on xs was big so would need to try the xxs next time but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me\\n\\ncolors are nice light but appropriate for fall or summer light fabri Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side but for me it was big too bad the smaller size is sold out well all peittes are sold out the length is also pretty long below the knee but in the narrow part stillso able to keep it the colors are great i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists adn they all loved it and told me to keep it winner for sure I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas i fell in love since i saw it the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this springsummer  and it has pockets on the sides dont we love pockets very practical and lightweight This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life sizing was mostly true to size for me slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips im 57 and 138 and ordered a size 4 i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts a 6 probably would have fit as well especially in the waist but didnt want it too big in the hips length was perfect to my knees This skirt is wonderful the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal but the quality is impeccable i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt it can be dressed up dressed down worn during all seasons the designpattern is artsy and whimsical without being too outthere unless you want it to be of course the fit is true to size and the delicate details are just lovely Like other reviewers noted the pics dont do this skirt justice it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors cant wait to wear this to work Love this skirt the detail is amazing runs small i ordered a 12 im usually a 10 but still a little snug Not keeping this one the fabric is a bit tackylooking in person the cut is odd and its just not me fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped the colors are as shown and it is a good length falls to top of hip i simply did not like it too metallic looking maybe The top as with most of aps tops is well stitched material is very uncomfortable if you have large bust it is a little divulging this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work welp thats out the window this design is poor for one this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i dont know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2 i have no torso so without a jacket i would never wear this its very low cutthe back is very lowits a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4 This top is so much better in person i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy it is not and i have sensitive skin i love this top and have got lots of compliments This is a lovely pencil skirt that is wellmade and really brightens a work day like a lot skirts with multiple colors a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact So  disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size i ordered the 10 im usually an 8 but that was sold out and the suit arrives and doesnt even fir over my hips  the label clearly says 10 australian us 6  gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue  the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store when i went in again i thought i would give it a try so glad i did  it fits great and is way way prettier in person  i ended up buying it and so glad i did  This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner it wasnt as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews however it ran a little big im 53 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6 but the six was too big id recommend sizing down it was also lower cut than i thought it would beshowed a lot of cleavage im a 34d so its not work appropriate  Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me  it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom i look like a clown costume  if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders  perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare  on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake not sure if its real leather The title says it allthis fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials shoulder is a knit sweaterlike navy fabric is interesting however that is where the positive comments end on this one the top is so scratchy stiff and frankly uncomfortable i cannot imagine wanting to wear it it could benefit from a lining and that might have solved the problem of scratchy itchy fabric\\n\\nthe stiff fabric of the bo My usual size 6 fits perfectly yes the metallic fibers on the inside are scratchy a cami solves that problem when ordering i realized i cld not go strapless  wld have to wear a one of my wider strap camis in navy or black to cover the bra strap area it was obvious some sort of coverup swtr or jacket wb needed  wld cover the strap area anyway so i also ordered the fauxfur cardi in the ivory to wear over this top its a shruglike cardi w 34 slvs comes in the plum also if you The online picture does not do this skirt justice its very pretty and unique in design i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture this is truly a pretty pencil skirt I bought this and like other reviews agree that the quality probably could be better but i still love it enough to keep the buckle fell apart but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak it has pilled but the fabric is textured so i didnt even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket  it is a perfect medium coat for 40s  50s before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter  i get compliments every time i wear it  love I bought a petite size 2 i am 53 111 lb  it fit perfect with a tiny bit of room looks just like the one pictured length on me was about 1 inch lower than the model very bright with multiple colors has a nice stretch very cute This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas its light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasnt sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online but the print is beautiful its a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest i like that it has enough coverage at the top front and back the underarms do not fall very low and it is lined the aline skirt will flatter most body types the fabric and overall q These pants are fun i use them as sleep pants i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort I ordered this in xs im 54 around 115lbs and it fits perfectly the material is very soft but not seethrough and the romper is wellmade i wish it came in other colours id buy more I purchased these for something other than sweats to wear for a girls get away weekend they were so comfortable and flattering friends told me i could wear them out for dinner\\n\\nthe fabric is beautiful and i loved the way they draped the angled cut on the legs is very cute and something a bit different these could be perfect for a hot summer evening dinner because the fabric is very light and breezy dress it up with a tank top and ballet flats and youre good to go Love this cream sleeveless topit goes with everything and you can dress it up or down this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater if needed i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length i am 57 34c and overall wt of approx 128 lbsit fits very nicely  thank you retailer This skirt is beautiful especially the color and looks well made however i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasnt flattering i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this Happy with this top slightly thinner material than i was expecting but thatll be fine with our hot summers got the navy striped one very pretty and extremely soft washes well i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra Love the fit of this sweater it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model it hits me just below the hips for ref im 53 im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable could be dressed up or down runs true to sizeim always a small and this fits perfectly roomy I love this sweater i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesnt look like a sack on me plus it is the perfect weight i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess it was overall too large the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining i would have liked it better the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out returned Love this tunic i am a curvy gal with a few extra curves in the middle and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy pink a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture i found it true to size typically i wear a medium or large depending on the structure and the medium fit well a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas it is Loved the green color the cut is super flattering but alas i do need hte petite ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost unfrotuantely the color is sold out in petite  But i thought this was lace or with texture it is more a pattern on regular fabric\\n\\ncolors are nice there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern the fit is nice the 0p fit snugly enough i dont think there was much give but that was comfortable enough petite length did end below the knee as shown i think it would have been nicer shorter but dont want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behindmaybe on sale  I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything im 57 size 1012 and the large fit just right Beautiful color great quality and great fit if you size up i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small i usually wear a 02 and i took a risk and went for the 4 it fits perfectly i have a 25 in waist Online this looks like a great sweater i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured in fact im pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer unfortunately this sweater will not work for me as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture but i had wishful thinking i should have gone with my gut this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases it is seethrough and flimsy the bottom is just like the picture it hangs in an odd rumpled way the top is very flattering though so its a shame if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu This skirt is a great length and nice piece for fallwinter i love the color it fits like a high waisted skirt would which is why i purchased the next size up This easel caftan is simply amazing the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress Just came today the print is gorgeous  very bohemian its a dressier dress with the chiffon  on the con side the chiffon is very delicate snagged easily while trying on theres raw edges on the waistband needed trimming fresh out of the package  sz 10 fit in the waist too small for 36d bust sz 12 fits bust but is big in the waist  sz 10 ankle length for 57 12 hits the floor  havent decided if ill keep the 12 and try to alter My waist measures 28 and the size 4 is a snug fit i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts but the 2 was unbearably tight cute skirt though i like that its machine washable and the quality looks good I love the fabric and color i bought the green one my only complaint is that the base is wider than the picture shows it looks more fitted on the model it is more of an a shape significantly wider at the hips I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately its going back because the knit is just too thin i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but its not and because its so light the swing effect doesnt really come off nothing special I love the color of this skirt and the fabric is wonderful it was a bit longer than anticipated but fit well Dress ran very large in every way beautiful design lining and quality material i should have sized down 2 sizes item is now sold out Finally a swing top that doesnt look like a sack on me ive been wanting to partake of this current style but everything ive tried so far just looks dumpy on me not this top  it is very feminine and flattering i am 57 118 lbs and have a small waist  and although this is a swing style it still shows my waist and doesnt overpower me it is also a lovely fabric  especially in the soft pink which i got im thinking of going back for more colors I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it so many people compliment it i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up obviously with a statement necklace too but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink which i hope it doesnt because it is one of my favorite pieces \\n\\nunlike the other reviewer i did not think that the Unlike the other reviewers i did not have any problem with the sizing fit or length of this skirt it is a midi skirt so i think its suppose to be a little bit longer for me it fit true to size for reference i am 58 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good For a now feel that comfy and well made this was a great choice This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it however on the third wear the side zipper split wide open needless to say it was returned Dang i got a small and was still swimming in it its made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things tshirty soft and thinish a bit translucent id rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering back it went Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost fabric feels cheap like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly did not flatter the female form felt like a burlap sack gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag returned it Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like im pregnant not that theres anything wrong with that very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf I loved this top it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white however on this one the chest area is too big in both the 14 and 16 and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big i probably need a size 12 but then i fear it would be too shortwaisted on me for i am 510 unfortunately it is not for me also the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist i am normally a 810 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable the quality is ok something i feel i would see at another type of discount store for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges im a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesnt make the wearer look big it falls elegantly and in a flattering way\\n\\ngreat versatile shirt I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length with my height and amount of material became overwhelming on me it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well Gorgeous top very nice detail work soft and flattering i dont think its too full on the bottom at all  mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette word of warning soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink  and definitely not my color if peach isnt flattering on you heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade bummer that i thought the other reviewers might Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected it is soft to the skin and flattering however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders I have already worn this several times it is very flattering lightweight and easy to wear dressy but also very soft and comfortable Very pretty fabric and beautiful color but i agree with the other reviewer here the fit is a bit strange the waist is very small  need to size up at least one size for that to fit  while the rest fits nicely its also a little longer than i had expectedsort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter and im 511 I was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine\\nappeal while the material was not v Im 54 130 lbs 34 d i bought the medium i think i could have gotten the small but i didnt have time to reorder it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half i love the length and the fabric The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception  looks just like the pictures colorscutdrape with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep vneck  sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff  this dress does not stretchthe bodice felt very fitted and tight especially at the waist band  runs tts or small if youre bustybroad shouldered size up  it has a dreadful side zip is fully lined and all synthetic fabric boo  i purchased size 10p my stats 36c382735135 Bought a large could barely pull up over my butt runs extremely small its cute but if your not a stick figure this is not the suit for you Adorable too chilly now to wear alone  too cute to cover it up my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w it though size 6 fits me perfectly  looks pretty much on me as in the pic love plaid  cotton blend tops anyways ruffles  adorable  im not too big on that but do love this look when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd smokylike odor but its the dye i think after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared i have in mind to wear w the pilcr This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess  falls in the right area and absolutely adorable  the dress is very fragile handle with care This is my new favorite top looks and fits as described Last minute i needed a familyfriendly top for a chilly night so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso this has a nice aline shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila i am a model just Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels easy piece to wear many ways great quality too This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season the style with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side wont have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric its warm without being bulky and to top it off it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone extraordinary to say the least I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that its flattering light weight and unique ive received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress i am 5 6 150 lbs hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium 810 and chose a small for this dress id say its still loose on me which is what i prefer the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra however ive noticed im more comfortable wearing a camisole or s The inseam is advertised as 28 but they are more like 38 i was hoping they were for short people but they are for someone with very long legs event in my tallest heels id have to get them hemmed just a warning to my short friends out there the quality fit look was great but way way way too long I love paige brand pantsthey are soft comfortable and forgiving i love these and want them badly the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flareit is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like thisand paige has done a wonderful job for my body\\n\\nmy store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length they were significantly too long for me 53 probably 34 inches to long i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for This top is really pretty and nice quality runs big  i went down a size and its perfect coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo So i love pilcro i wear them all the time and usually size down because they grow after wearing them i tried on my usual size in these and felt like they are too tight not sure if they will get any looser the material feels really good lightweight and the stripes are subtle but cute not sure if ill keep them or maybe size up This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer or warmer climates  very fresh and airy the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight it is not too thin or see through ii does not get overly wrinkled either the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down the v neck is just right not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage but deep enough to be feminine and slimming i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses Petite pants hsould be able to fit short peple but a 32 inch inseam on pants with buttons at the nottom cant even gegt them hemmed what a bummer my inseam is 27 inchess so i would need a 5 inch heel otherwise gorgeous and waiat fits true to size thighs a bit snug for musclea but stretchy enough to fit thinking about keeping them but have to find big plaform heeks I tried on the petite size in my usual xs adn i actually have to go down to xxs i looked overtaken by the shirt im 52 and 115lbs\\n\\ncut is flowy and not close to the body sleeves are narrower but still ok with athletic built\\n\\ncolor light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair but for my pale self the darker one was better but cant go wrong i ordered both colors and liked both of them\\n\\nruffle is a great addition too I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino great for hot days of summer\\nthe subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg overall a really flattering cut the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top The shirt is absolutely cute looking but thats just thatlooks im 52 size 6  wears m to l top i tried on the medium in the store it was rather flowing i liked it but i didnt like how it fit on the underarm area it hung very low so i ordered a petite m still the same plus the store the lighting was dark so i didnt realize how see through the shirt was too had to return it These jeans i tried these on in addition to the high rise paige denim and these won out hands down classic flattering fit from mother with an element of edginess with the frayed hem these are long enough on me im 55 to cuff at the ankle if i dont want a distressed look on a particular day they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down i have muscular calves and thighs but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller\\nit runs very generous and so the sizing is a little off\\nthe style and quality are beautiful so i am anxious to receive the smaller size The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs\\n\\nvery comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there I got a small mauve the fit is great and the length is perfect for me just few inches above my knees\\ncute and cozy what more can i aske for I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color these are less flattering and i may not keep them Fun detail with the beading and lace arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected but thats the style of the piece the fit was tts with those proportions mind  the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up it might be a little longer in the body but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change the material isnt too thick so its a nice lighter layer for fallspring really love it I love the style of this top and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts its somewhat fitted on the top yet its aline shape gives a full swing at the bottom the ruffled vneckline is pretty and i like the longer length of the short sleeves but with all these attributes unfortunately they cut the armholes really big so when you put your arms forward the sleeves pull against your arms i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway but for 98 dollars i thin Ordered these online and they fit perfectly i was looking for lightweight pants for hot and humid summer days and this pair is exactly what i needed the striped pattern is cute and adds some color I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent soft fabric and for a whitelightly striped dress not sheer im bummed because after washing only twice followed the instructions to wash on gentle cycle and low tumble dry holes started appearing everywhere both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest in the white part of the fabric only it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews but i should have ordered my own size as theyre a bit loose around the waist the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering so i definitely recommend them I really want to love this shirt but the small is just way too big on me for reference im a 32d which is why i didnt want to size down much more than a small 56 and 125 and im drowning in this im going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality just size down a couple of sizes Love pilcro love the stripes and the length  but this particular pair of capriscrops are super tight fitting i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight i guess its just the cutfabric combo i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel  may work for you however This is exactly what i was expecting cute comfortable and casual there are some gold sequins in the scroll work that i didnt see online they are super pretty in person I tried these on in the store and they are super cute but run small i typically wear a size 25 im 5 5 and 108 lbs and they were too tight for me i like the fabric and the cut i think theyd be great one size up my store didnt have them Really nice substantial fully lined sweater coat i love the structured look and the fauxleather piping around the zipper and the pockets quality seems to be very good it runs true to size maybe slightly on the small side especially for larger hipsbusts so if you are in between sizes go up i chose small and its just right i wouldnt be able to zip around my hips with xsmall besides the price which is why i dropped one star i cannot really find any fault in this sweater coat Really pretty but runs at least a full size small I love these pants i have worn them a number of times already this season i am 5 so i did have to have them hemmed i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i dont think they look odd i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks I love this tunic the natural color is just that this is a tunic so the fit is a little large i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute they seem to run just a bit small i sized up one size from my usual and dont seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite great comfy casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up highly recommend for summer Size down i love this item it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some Cute swing top that would be flattering on most i love the print on the white color and its so soft doesnt wrinkle easy but it does run big im usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it so size down I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly it fits me very well im 52 34b 26 waist 36 hips the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model i like the vneck the most because the ruffles are not too much and its not too low cut i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and its brighter for springsummer i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish by the way the fabric is super soft but not w This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers it runs very small im typically an 8 or 10 if i get a 10 there is usually a bit of room in the item i decided to get a 10 in this skirt just in case i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely Fits well through the shoulders and arms but there is zero waist and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top super cute but have to return because of that From the picture i wasnt sure how it would fit got in the mail and i love it fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it definitely should of gotten a large I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily other than that the silhouette of the coat is perfectnot too boxy its also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter i love it This top is very cute got it in the lighter color the fit is great and it will go with many things if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesnt seem to be a womans white t on the planet that isnt these days however it was really sheer the fit was also short and boxy this coming from a 53 woman who is shortwaisted on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute maybe if you are younger and dont mind the sheerness its worth the gambl This is a perfect jacket over any shirt tee or dress jacket is well made and goes with anything I ordered this dress in both colors the peach color is so beautiful in person im planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer if i can hold off until then definitely worth the price This dress is incredible i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it i bought it in the navy color its gorgeous in person very bright vibrant colors i am 59 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out and got it taken in a bit i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads if youre thinking about buying this dress do it you wont regret it Love the look and quality of this jacket iamp39d say it fits true to size but it is way too short for me iamp39m just under 6amp39 tall wish these came in tall sizes I really love the front of this shirt however the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it doesnt seem to match the front of the shirt i still wear it and it looks cute but it threw me off a bit at first Absolutely love this dress fits true to size and makes anyone look fabulous I liked the color of this top but i didnt really like the ruffled stitching around the middle it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half i bought this for my daughter and she likes it i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in Per other reviewers i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers it is short cropped but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses I have alst years versiona dn they are essentially the smae minus some leather parts removed this jacket is great the back si a little shorter so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out i love hte darker color i wish it came is super dark rinse\\n\\ni usually buy petites but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket i am holding myself back to order this on Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color will have do to the nice quality and wear very stylish for a loooooong time\\n\\na must have for the summer Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details soft and not baggy a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier im 57 140 pounds with an athletic hourglass shape 32dd i bought the 2 which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt im normally an retailer small but i dont think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted great comfy weekend piece I could wear this every day it is stylish and comfortable Pretty top love the color and the large ruffle makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace Love this top\\nit is a full swing top but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly\\ni have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments\\nlove both colors and having fun wearing them\\nand after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic\\nruns true to size and in the arms slightly tight so i went with my usual med and fits perfect\\nif you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size otherwise very true to size The styling of this top is really cute it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look my biggest complaint is the quality its really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge it curls really badly i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time not worth the  if paying full price Love love love this dress it is very slimming it hugs you without really touching you leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel Im 53 130 with a 32dd bust i usually wear small in retailer cloth and stone running horses the small fit me fine but with no room for layers underneath the small was very snug would be perfect for california evenings but i live in the north east the medium still has a great shape on me still fitted at the waist 27inches but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress This dress is gorgeous i love it i bought it to wear to a july wedding i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color the sizing is on spot i slipped it on and it was comfortable easy and stylish i am 57 and typically xs it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight i am in love This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend the first time i wore it i received so many compliments I want to live in this sweatshirt its so comfy but also wellcut and lays nicely not boxy at all im typically a 1012 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy I liked this top even though it was a definite swing style i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness\\nlooks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look very soft and comfortable fabric wish it was just a little bit longer After missing out on last years similar dress i am so glad i finally purchased this one it is beautiful in person i bought to wear to a wedding but i am curious if others think it might be too white i bought the peach color i will keep this dress no matter what hope they come out with more next season Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy it must be pinned in the picture online its very frustrating when they do that thank goodness i didnt pay for shipping for reference im 52 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs its going back for sure im trying to lose baby weight not trying to look pregnant I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket darker color of denim with weathered edges i absolutely love it dont let it get away great jean jackets are hard to come by I wanted to love this sweatshirt but alas it is going back upon opening and unfolding the first thing i noticed the dots and not solid they are sort of distressed looking with parts of them missing secondly it doesnt have a lot of structure its soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way its just not flattering on me it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house for reference i ordered the 3 and im usually a 1012 in tops Love this denim jacket also have it in white the reason i didnt give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much none on the back which is kind of strange id love it even more if it wasnt distressed at all then it could be dressed up much more for work but overall its my favorite great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy please make this in some other denim colors The cut is brilliantthe wash is subtlethe weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuffand the stretch is just right love it the perfect staple a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring Love it the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim I love these im between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s they fit well as expected very nice fabric good design have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice Ive been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff id prefer a softer kind of fabric i wonder if it would soften if it was washed also it ran surprisingly small i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didnt leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms the medium worked better i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing i think ill wait and see if this one goes on sal I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and havent found one i really liked againuntil now great quality  just heavy enough but not too heavy just stretchy enough but not too stretchy great colordesign no complaints i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago which is a big endo Beautiful colors and silhouette i got the navy the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk ive gotten a ton of compliments on it im 59 and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee and the low hem falls to my ankles I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring  summer the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tuckedin the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color Im glad i listened to the other reviewersi ordered a large instead of my usual medium its roomy enough for a sweater underneath i love the denim its very soft and has some stretch my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing i also love the darker denim Im 54 125 lbs ordered small fits perfect super soft denim love the color love the worn in feel This dress is stunning vibrant colors and flirty feel to it i got the small and i am a 34b27 pants 132 lbs great fit i only question two things am i tall enough to pull off the extra fabric in the back and what the heck do you where for a bra those two considerations are why i didnt give it 5 stars I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it i love the darker color more modern day less 80s it runs a little small i am always either a s or xs at retailer lately their clothes seem to be running a little bigger so i have been an xs in most tops when i order online i never know which size to get i ordered an xs however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up so i returned it for a s and it fits great i was I have received so many compliments its my favorite I wore this dress for the first time yesterday i have never received so many compliments on a dress before several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was\\nit is an absolute musthave I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants I love this little jean jacket i am petite and usually get a xxsp  but went for a size up im glad i did it fits a little snug the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me i love this  over maxi dresses tanks etc adorable jacket  great buy This dress first caught my eye online due to the price i resisted then i saw in store and tried oni decided to hold off for a sale but my will was getting thin once i saw it start to sell out online i had to take the plunge i knew this dress was a must have it is super flattering and comfy the best of both worlds im smallchested so both the s and m fit but the seam on the s fit a bit higher which was more flattering on me so s is what i got it can be dressed up or slightly down I love this blouse i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging i dont live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively i have larger hips 135lbs 56 and finding flattering tops can be tough sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on they just dont look right some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter this top looked great a First i ordered a m im normally a 810 the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole i love this jacket but cannot keep it in its condition hopefully i will make it to the store soon there are none win an hour of me and look before i buy I purchased the navy color of this dress not only did it look good but felt good as well since it is for a wedding i also purchased a white crochet cropped sweater to wear over as well making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom could not have been happier This top looks pretty much like it does not the model the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight the fabric is light weight but not seethrough it does not wrinkle a lot ive gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too the vneck is pretty deep but doesnt show so much cleavage that you couldnt wear it to work Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace also runs very large i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso very unflattering cut I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it i found it to be pretty true to size even after washing its a little sheer so youd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work its a great top for springsummer I thought this top was adorable in the store and online it just didnt work for me although it fit it flares out too much in the front and just wasnt flattering on me i am 5 5 and 128 lbs and ordered the small Love this top made with 100 cotton a vintage look and flattering details this top is a winner for me i think it fits true to size got my regular size 0 and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short 53 it is somewhat see through but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work i think it can be worn without a cami the perfect lightweight comfortable standout piece for the summer time  I really like this blouse a lot very very easy to wear i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend very flattering and great blue color very happy with this purchase highly recommend i am 56 short torso and my usual 6 worked I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it i almost always wear a size small at retailer 34d2735 and the fit and length are both perfect on me if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations i didnt know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm havent worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items im usually an extrasmall but the xxs also fits its a great buy especially since its on sale now This is an awesome vest  so soft cozy and i cannot wait to wear it through fall and winter for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did ill mention the one flawno pockets  still totally worth full price in my mind though I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small im usually an 8 but needed this in a 10 this shirt is reallly just perfect great sleeve length just the right amount of v neck beautiful pattern with a vintage feel i love the combo of stripes polka dots and sweet flowers This blouse is so pretty i love the long tie the pattern is very unique it is a thin light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket This is a beautiful blousesheer and feminine i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual it is a full topcant tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size this is supposed to be a full shorter fiti would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b The photo of these is truly misleading  they are a beautiful vibrant print  see the closeup photo they are much longer on a regular person  they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 55there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each like a pleat that really allows a nice flow these look great with boots flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large not lined but drape beautifully there are pockets sewn closed upon purchase and pack pockets Like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short im only 52 xs and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model also the quality isnt great as its very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front its a shame bc the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique sadly its going back I didnt think anything of this top online i really dont care for how they styled it but in store it was more interesting im currently anywhere between a 246  xssm depending on the style 53 120lb 34b size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly for some reason on me the sleeves were elongating and flattering closer to my elbow and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but due to the color and p Nice fabric and cute design a little low cut I absolutely love this sweater its soft easy to wash and looks great The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering very happy with this purchase i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish I had high hopes for this top really boxy short This dress has potential but it didnt work for me it runs true to size to a little big i ordered medium my usual size for maeve as for length it fit me as the model 59 the reason im not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit I love this tee the material is thick but not too thick its highly flattering i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings the shimmer on the front adds something special I got this top in the black and i love it the bottom is a silky material thats really beautiful and the cutout details are really pretty so many of retailers sweaters are enormous but this one fits tts \\n\\nmy one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily This top was way too short im only 51 and way too wide the cut of this top was so wide it looked like a tent on me i really wanted to love this top because the material and style sleeves ruffle are beautiful unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut ive have several blouses made by one fine day which fit nicely for some reason this top did not i ordered in my usual s size even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter its versatile i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs theres so many options i cannot wait to put this gorgeous piece to use just as an fyi the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them this may not even be noticeable if youre not looking right up close for me this adds to the unique quality I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person the description didnt give as much information as i wanted so im going to be very detailed in this review i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time and ill have to hand sew others on more tightly my usual size is a pxs or p0 and there were no petite sizes available however the size 0 fits perfectly no alterations need When i received this blouse ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky some of the fabric would stick to these dots i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid however after hanging on my closet door the dots are still sticky i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me Wasnt sure about this top based on reviews but glad i purchased pretty print looks great with denim very loose flowy top hangs a little short but thats the style of this blouse fit true to size i usually wear a 24 and xssm with 30dd size small worked for me Ordered the shirt online beautiful print and good quality material runs very large  size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide i will be exchanging it in the store This too is so beautiful in person there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming i love this top with business attire and denim fits tts I tried this in the store and i like it  nice and soft good basic design that will pair with many pieces but i decided to wait because of the price im sure i would get a lot of use out of this top but ultimately it didnt thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase i bought a sweater that was on sale instead still a very nice top i may buy it eventually especially if it goes on sale Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely it is a soft soft fabric almost fleecelike but not plush I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal I am 56 138 pounds i purchased this in a size small it is flowy and not too short it has a comfortable but still feminine and beautiful fit one of my favorite new blousesthe red print is gorgeous This top light and airy which is perfect for spring im usually into these types of blouses however this didnt quite fit right on me its a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason i loved the design and really wanted to like it i just didnt love it enough to purchase it This blouse is so beautiful  the collar sleeves materialeverything except the cut it was like a tent it needed to be more tapered which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow and be about two inches longer\\n\\ni had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed please fix it and then i will buy again i am 54 140lbs and bustya small was perfect with the exception of the massive amount of material Very pretty blouse i love the print and color of the pink floral tts i ordered the xs because of the roomy cut of the blouse im 58 117 lbs it fit great the cut is a little wider then pictured but still cute not to short as mentioned by another review and i have a longer torso i wasnt crazy about the victorian collar so tucked it under and it looks great I normally wear a large or extralarge the medium is still very billowy on me this blouse is ethereal and lovely though  pretty and funky at the same time its sheer but somehow not revealing perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer Not a coat by any means merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isnt pretty enough for a spring coatsizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated I saw this instore tried it on and was sold it is not just super soft but very flattering on i am petite 105 lbs and bought the xs in black the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans Love this its heavywarm stylish and a great throw on any outfit oversized style The fabric was nothing special i usually like a cottonsilk blend woven fabric but this was stiff feeling and the pattern was cute but what made me return it was the fact that 1 the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint literally puffy paint and 2 the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it i could barely unfold it\\n\\nim sure this could have been cute but who wants a top that looks lik Tts im wearing a small the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants washed nicely layers flat to dry had to iron the shell underneath great for casual office This top is good quality and cute it runs large im usually a medium and needed a small the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on it makes me look wide in the waist or like im wearing a maternity top unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it Im a pretty solid 1012 in this brand i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run smalland i agree while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear its tight in the shoulders and chest for the record those are 2 areas i never have problems with im a 36b and it was flattening my chest it was also quite short on me i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12 I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester polyrayon blend in it and i dont like polyester still i couldnt pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat its like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing its a little on the pricey side since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat i would have liked the price better if it was 100 less it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on i I like this sleeveless sweater  it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk paired with blackwhite patterns its pretty versatile as seen in the pics  a great staple for a more casual office environment being a taller girl i love the length on it and find its flattering for my curvy figure This blouse is super cute but oddly sized i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage so this had to go back i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer i just couldnt make it work\\n I love the sweatshirt \\n clay color is very different its a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges \\n although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite\\n great light sweatshirt for spring and summer Love the patterns and the length  i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets \\nits really a special piece and on sale very worth it Very comfy and light can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it i am either an xs or s in antho and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy normally i would have overlooked this shirt as its rather unimpressive on the hanger but it was on sale so i tried it on very cute when tried on it fits well across the shoulders but isnt too clingy in the body which i like the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews i am tall and have a long torso so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering maybe if your taller it hangs better i have to say i love everything about it it is a fantastic print it is very flowy but i dont think its too much in that regard i think it is fitting with the romantic girly style of the garment in my opinion not too short just right i took a medium i am 58 and athletic I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite unfortunately the fabric was stiff it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there returned All the rave reviews are true  this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it im having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this this is a great three season layering piece and im thrilled i was able to get it on sale  my only regret was the lack of a petite selection I love this top i got it on sale and am so glad that i did it is a short too but still super flattering it isnt too boxy on me I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xss although its wool i didnt notice that is was itchy  usually wool bothers me i am of small build but i did like the long  oversized look i admit i am drawn to the print anyways i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xss  it was the same probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xss in a few wks since the invent This has great drape length the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck so not sure if i will keep though i dont seem to want to take it off has a lightweight boiled wool texture contrasting print and design so cool I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person and it was love at first sight the black and white makes it versatile and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward more importantly the pattern is cleverly designed which doesnt compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern as shown on model i purchased the regular xss and it fit me fine im 52 34b 26 waist and 36 hips and the hem falls about two inches below my knees the Surprisingly flattering on especially with pantsjeans extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws the pleating enhances the bust the vcut provides a touch of a peekaboo not enough to show cleavage but its there in a super flattering way the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office under a jacket or just plain for going out the material is not too thick but not The top runs small it is a very sexy and slimming top i tried in l it was too small so i have ordered it in xl i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this but it is a very sexy good looking and slimming top i love it I was looking for a basic tee but this one was just okthe quality is okay but it us not as soft as i would have liked unfortunately  i will be returning this item An excellent going out to dinner to a lounge etc piece super flattering sexy feminine and trendy can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories im only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits but this was excellent I wouldve looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy im usually a m but went with the s bc it looked better fitted this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy i cant wait to wear would look great with white jeans This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness  i like everything about it Ive been looking for the perfect workappropriate lace dress for a casualcreative work environment for a while and this was just the ticket the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace i rolled the sleeves to a shortsleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more although the sleeves worn long are absolutely gorgeous the lace isnt exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used but pretty nonetheless im 55 125 and th Disappointed in the quality of the dress love the style and especially the colors the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made the top bodice is more substantial not worth the price tag of 14800 dress does run short Comfy cozy and a bit on the big size even for an oversized piece order a size down even if you want a boxier look unsure how the fabric will hold upbut if it does it will be a great get This dress is not what i expected the bottom half is woollike materiallooks like someone has worn it the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms i wouldnt of paid full price but for the amount i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large  so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly love the length it hits mid hip it is more of an aline than straight as show in the picture the detail is fun and the sweater is well made highly recommend it i have received lots of compliments on this sweater I love this top its design is very pretty and like nothing that i have i think this top runs true to size im usually an xss in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily so while wearing it you have to be very careful This skirt is very short i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle thats quite off because im only 5 feet tall and i wore it pretty low on the hips it also flares out awkwardly below the knee there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt plus the fabricwhile thick and beautiful and stretchyhas a This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it  love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight so definitely appropriate for winter fall and cooler spring days i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot  it was wider down the torso and a little shorter not tunic length like picture im 57 with a longer torso and this hit maybe midbum and I really like the appearance of this item and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings it does run a little large i am a true to size small and this hangs on me a little but i love the design of the back it is so soft and comfortable I dont normally review my purchases but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made i couldnt help myself but to post a review the neck line isnt even hemmed down so it flaps up the material is thin and feel cheap this dress isnt even worth 20 in my opinion i was expecting a well made good quality dress for the high price tag Ordered this dress online and i love it i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist but for the most part the dress fit very well and was very flattering may just need a little bit of ironing i am 59 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips and I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear however after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing so i tried it on what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person and very soft and warm its a perfect winter sweater to start the new year i am 57 138 lbs and the medium fit perfectly though its a little shorter on me than shown in the photos If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you cant fully close this robe the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit the fabric is soft and lux and amazing but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day Like the reviewers before me this dress runs small in the rib cage i normally take a 12 and am a 32b the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12 it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top there is no wiggle room in the dress \\n\\nthat being said it is a really cute style and shape  rather like a 50s style dress if you will with a sexy back i am curvy on the bottom and this dress hides the flaws there for sure however because it is a fulle I should have exchanged it for a smaller size but i wanted to wear it so my mistake i tend to wear size 1214 and the large is entirely too big it also had piling right out of the bag but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway if you get this size down for sure Im surprised other reviewers loved this one so much its completely different then how it looks on the model its much shorter which others do mention but it flares a lot enough to feel maternityish on me it looks fitted on the model maybe its my shape i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips i ordered an xs too i will say the material\\nis very nice and its well made but its going back This sweater is fine for the casual days i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old im a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears very soft but poor material not my favorite purchase Great fit no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size very cute for reference i39m 5392 115 lbs and take a 26p they look just like they do on the model i highly recommend Just tried layered sadie top and it felt so nice on good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed this item is definitely vanitysized im 51 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternityesque highly recommend because its gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you Im 54 between sizes 12 and 14 i ordered a size petite large and its a bit loose which is acceptable but id like to try a regular size medium to see if itd be more fitted like i see in the model\\nmy problem is with the length i read the description and it says petite  405 of length the large petite i ordered is above my knees this is not 40 of length by any means its 365\\nid really appreciate if the size info was correctly available This is a great long sleeve casual shirt for spring  soft and airy pairs well with jeans i found that it fit me just right im not very tall but my shoulders are a little broad for my height which typically puts me in the smallmedium range so i got size 6 regular this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel my only problem is there aren I love this dress the fit is incredibly flattering and im currently carrying more weight than my normal size i selected a 6 which is about a size larger than normal and it was a perfect fit i tried on a larger size for measure and the 6 provided a perfect fit and flare ive worn the dress on three occasions already and each time friends remarked on their admiration for the dress itself and flattering style for me i have no issues at all with the cut and to me the bias a This top is very light weight and comfortable i am normally a 810 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews it fits great i really like the fit and the pattern it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie This is a precious its a little thin as i prefer a thicker fabric however wearing a tank top under it works perfectly i have it now in both colors great price on sale I got this shirt in red plaid and love it super cute without being too trendy i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments I originally purchased this dress in a petite 6 i am 53 125lbs with a 36 bust the petite 6 was a bit too tight so i returned it and went up to a size 8 so happy i did this dress drapes and flows beautifully and i find it immensely flattering to my hourglass figure i also adore the floral print one reviewer objected to the way the bodice drapes and the very small hook closure which seemed insufficient i did not object to this characteristic it fit me beautifully throughout the bodice This is not usually a top that i am attracted to but it is so cute paired with jeans and sandals nice lightweight top for summer Im petite and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater  that is the look that is portrayed on the model the sweater is scratchy the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right it looks great on the model here but not on me going back so bummed the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little holes or openings across the shoulders so there is a tiny bit of detail overall not a great sweater I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for springsummer for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown this dress has no shape to it although probably comfortable not flattering i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture in person This dress is very flattering comfortable and made me feel pretty I love this dress but it definitely runs big i bought a size small and im between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs the top feels like it will fall down and im a size 34c So soft such beautiful fabric it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured one of my favorite retailer purchases to date This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug and im relatively slim in the hips I bought this sweater because i love twinkles knitting patterns and yarns this sweater doesnt disappoint i love all of the great details like the detachable collar the double buttons along the front and the back panel is in a seed stitch which differs from the front and sleeve stitch its super warm and cozy but its also very heavy depending on the temp outside i can wear this as a coat but i think the sweater will stretch over time because its so heavy Love the look its a little tight but i still like it'"

       "Absolutely wonderful silky and sexy and comfortable Love this dress its sooo pretty i happened to find it in a store and im glad i did bc i never would have ordered it online bc its petite i bought a petite and am 58 i love the length on me hits just a little below the knee would definitely be a true midi on someone who is truly petite I had such high hopes for this dress and really wanted it to work for me i initially ordered the petite small my usual size but i found this to be outrageously small so small in fact that i could not zip it up i reordered it in petite medium which was just ok overall the top half was comfortable and fit nicely but the bottom half had a very tight under layer and several somewhat cheap net over layers imo a major design flaw was the net over layer sewn directly into the zipper it c I love love love this jumpsuit its fun flirty and fabulous every time i wear it i get nothing but great compliments This shirt is very flattering to all due to the adjustable front tie it is the perfect length to wear with leggings and it is sleeveless so it pairs well with any cardigan love this shirt I love tracy reese dresses but this one is not for the very petite i am just under 5 feet tall and usually wear a 0p in this brand this dress was very pretty out of the package but its a lot of dress the skirt is long and very full so it overwhelmed my small frame not a stranger to alterations shortening and narrowing the skirt would take away from the embellishment of the garment i love the color and the idea of the style but it just did not work on me i returned this dress I aded this in my basket at hte last mintue to see what it would look like in person store pick up i went with teh darkler color only because i am so pale hte color is really gorgeous and turns out it mathced everythiing i was trying on with it prefectly it is a little baggy on me and hte xs is hte msallet size bummer no petite i decided to jkeep it though because as i said it matvehd everything my ejans pants and the 3 skirts i waas trying on of which i kept all oops I ordered this in carbon for store pick up and had a ton of stuff as always to try on and used this top to pair skirts and pants everything went with it the color is really nice charcoal with shimmer and went well with pencil skirts flare pants etc my only compaint is it is a bit big sleeves are long and it doesnt go in petite also a bit loose for me but no xxs so i kept it and wil ldecide later since the light color is already sold out in hte smallest size I love this dress i usually get an xs but it runs a little snug in bust so i ordered up a size very flattering and feminine with the usual retailer flair for style Im 55 and 125 lbs i ordered the s petite to make sure the length wasnt too long i typically wear an xs regular in retailer dresses if youre less busty 34b cup or smaller a s petite will fit you perfectly snug but not tight i love that i could dress it up for a party or down for work i love that the tulle is longer then the fabric underneath Dress runs small esp where the zipper area runs i ordered the sp which typically fits me and it was very tight the material on the top looks and feels very cheap that even just pulling on it will cause it to rip the fabric pretty disappointed as it was going to be my christmas dress this year needless to say it will be going back This dress is perfection so pretty and flattering More and more i find myself reliant on the reviews written by savvy shoppers before me and for the most past they are right on in their estimation of the product in the case of this dressif it had not been for the reveiwsi doubt i would have even tried this the dress is beautifully made lined and reminiscent of the old retailer quality it is lined in the solid periwinklecolored fabric that matches the outer fabric print tts and very formfitting falls just above the knee and does not rid Bought the black xs to go under the larkspur midi dress because they didnt bother lining the skirt portion grrrrrrrrrrr my stats are 34a282936 and the xs fit very smoothly around the chest and was flowy around my lower half so i would say its running big the straps are very pretty and it could easily be nightwear too im 56 and it came to just below my knees This is a nice choice for holiday gatherings i like that the length grazes the knee so it is conservative enough for office related gatherings the size small fit me well i am usually a size 24 with a small bust in my opinion it runs small and those with larger busts will definitely have to size up but then perhaps the waist will be too big the problem with this dress is the quality the fabrics are terrible the delicate netting type fabric on the top layer of skirt got stuck in the zip I took these out of the package and wanted them to fit so badly but i could tell before i put them on that they wouldnt these are for an hourglass figure i am more straight up and down the waist was way too small for my body shape and even if i sized up i could tell they would still be tight in the waist and too roomy in the hips for me that said they are really nice sturdy linenlike fabric pretty color well made i hope they make someone very happy Material and color is nice the leg opening is very large i am 51 100 and the length hits me right above my ankle with a leg opening the size of my waist and hem line above my ankle and front pleats to make me fluffy i think you can imagine that it is not a flattering look if you are at least average height or taller this may look good on you Took a chance on this blouse and so glad i did i wasnt crazy about how the blouse is photographed on the model i paired it whit white pants and it worked perfectly crisp and clean is how i would describe it launders well fits great drape is perfect wear tucked in or out cant go wrong A flattering super cozy coat will work well for cold dry days and will look good with jeans or a dressier outfit i am 5 5 about 135 and the small fits great I love the look and feel of this tulle dress i was looking for something different but not over the top for new years eve im small chested and the top of this dress is form fitting for a flattering look once i steamed the tulle it was perfect i ordered an xsp length was perfect too If this product was in petite i would get the petite the regular is a little long on me but a tailor can do a simple fix on that fits nicely im 54 130lb and pregnant so i bough t medium to grow into the tie can be front or back so provides for some nice flexibility on form fitting Im upset because for the price of the dress i thought it was embroidered no that is a print on the fabric i think i cried a little when i opened the box it is still ver pretty i would say it is true to size it is a tad bit big on me but i am very tiny but i can still get away with it the color is vibrant the style is unique skirt portion is pretty poofy i keep going back and forth on it mainly because of the price although the quality is definitely there except i wish it were emb First of all this is not pullover styling there is a side zipper i wouldnt have purchased it if i knew there was a side zipper because i have a large bust and side zippers are next to impossible for me second of all the tulle feels and looks cheap and the slip has an awkward tight shape underneath not at all what is looks like or is described as sadly will be returning but im sure i will find something to exchange it for Cute little dress fits tts it is a little high waisted good length for my 59 height i like the dress im just not in love with it i dont think it looks or feels cheap it appears just as pictured I love this shirt because when i first saw it i wasnt sure if it was a shirt or dress since it is seethrough if you wear it like a dress you will need a slip or wear it with leggings i bought a slip wore the tie in the back and rocked it with white wedges you could also wear it as a vest be careful with the buttons i havent had any fall off yet but i feel like they will overall its great for any occasion and its fun to wear Loved the material but i didnt really look at how long the dress was before i purchased both a large and a medium im 55 and there was atleast 5 of material at my feet the gaps in the front are much wider than they look felt like the dress just fell flat both were returned im usually a large and the med fit better 36d 30 in jeans I have been waiting for this sweater coat to ship for weeks and i was so excited for it to arrive this coat is not true to size and made me look short and squat the sleeves are very wide although long as a light weight fall coat the sleeves dont need to be as wide because you wouldnt be layerng too much underneath the buttons need to be moved at least three inches in for a nicer fit i thought about redoing the buttons myself but the sleeves looked even more out of proportion with a tigh The colors werent what i expected either the dark blue is much more vibrant and i just couldnt find anything to really go with it fabric is thick and good quality has nice weight and movement to it the skirt just wasnt for me in the end I have several of goodhyouman shirts and i get so many compliments on them especially the one that says forehead kisses are underrated dont hesitate buy this shirt you wont be sorry This sweater is so comfy and classic it balances a quirky handknit look with a beautiful color and practical fit it is a bit cropped and boxy as part of the style and as others mentioned there are gaps in the knit that make it seethrough in my opinion this makes it perfect for layering i like having a longer camisole showing underneath or wearing it over a little dress its warm but still thin enough to fit under a jacket or coat Beautifully made pants and on trend with the flared crop so much cuter in person love these I never would have given these pants a second look online in person they are much cuter the stripes are brighter and the fit more flattering the crop has a cute flare which is right on trend this brand has always run small for me i am 58 about 140lbs and carry some chubbiness in the belly i paired it with a collarless loose navy blazer These pants are even better in person the only downside is that they need to be dry cleaned I ordered this 3 months ago and it finally came off back order a huge disappointment the fit wasn39t so much the issue for me the quality of the wool is subpar someone else mentioned a quotfelted woolquoti guess is that what you call it it does literally feel like felt super thin itchy doesn39t drape very well and feels cheap made in china i got it on sale but still not worth what i paid definitely going back This is such a neat dress the color is great and the fabric is super soft i am tall so the long length was an added bonus it definitely needs something underneath since the front gaps i am going to pair it with a funky tank top necklaces and boots super cute Wouldnt have given them a second look but tried them on in store of a whim love love This is a comfortable skirt that can span seasons easily while not the most exciting design it is a good work skirt that can be paired with many tops Just ordered this in a small for me 56 135 size 4 and medium for my mom 53 130 size 8 and it is gorgeous beautifully draped all the weightwarmth ill need for houston fall and winter looks polished snapped or unsnapped ageappropriate for both my mom 60s and myself 30s will look amazing with skinny jeans or leggings we ordered the gray which is true to the photos Super cute and comfy pull over sizing is accurate material has a little bit of stretch Great casual top with flare looks cute with grey pilcro stet jeans flattering with peplum in back nice cut for shoulders and neckline Pretty and unique great with jeans or i have worn it to work with slacks and heels the colors print and embroidery are lovely reasonably priced This is a beautiful top its unique and not so ordinary i bought my usual medium and i found that it fits tight across my chest although i had a baby this year and i am nursing so that could be why if i bought again i would size up This poncho is so cute i love the plaid check design the colors look like sorbet cream and it will pair well with a turtleneck and jeans or pencil skirt and heels i love this look for fall and it can roll right into spring great buy First this is thermal so naturally i didnt expect super sheer but it is really sheer light fabric i like it but be prepared for considering who you might run into if you walk around the house in it second it is large i ordered the size 0 and its a nice oversized fit for my 53 125 pounds i wouldnt want to go larger along with being sheer the fabric is easily stretched which i dont mind in this case finally the color it looks white on my monitor and shows a colorful blue dot Tried this on today at my local retailer and had to have it it is so comfortable and flattering its too bad the picture online has the model tucking it into the skirt because you cant see the ruching across the front a little dressier alternative to a plain tee and reasonably priced for retailer 58 and i generally wear a 6 the small fit well will probably be back for the black I bought this item from online the fit on the model looked a little loose but when i got mine it seemed a bit tight so i took it back to the store ordered a larger size for the sale price this is a great top I love this top i wear it all the time the problem is that you can tell i wear it all the time as the fabric has started to fade id still recommend it as it is so comfortable Very comfortable material is good cut out on sleeves flattering This sweater is perfect for fallits roomy warm super comfy and the color really pops Really cute top the embroidery on the collar bib of this top is beautiful and unique received lots of compliments questions about where i got it im rather busty up top and the medium fit well a small probably wouldve fit better but its still super adorable This is a cute top that can transition easily from summer to fall it fits well nice print and its comfortable i tried this on in the store but did not purchase it because the color washed me out this is not the best color for a blonde would look much better on a brunette if this was in a different color i most likely would have purchased it I absolutely love this bib tee its probably my favorite retailer purchase of all time im 57 140 pounds and the small was a perfect fit for me i typically wear either a s or m tops Love the color and style but material snags easily Very soft and comfortable the shirt has an unusual asymmetrical seam that appears along the front righthand side of the garment the model is positioned so that you cant see this detail from the picture i attached a picture that includes the front seam i actually like the seam it creates more visual interest and adds a little bit of ruching that helps hide my belly the cowl neck is very well done there are two layers that form the cowl and ive found that it means wardrobe malfun Nice top armholes are a bit oversized but as an older woman im picky about that the print is pretty and unusual it just didnt look great on me theres a slight peplum in the back that hangs nicely its a lightweight tee fabric thats opaque i tried it on with a black bra which was barely visible great for warmer climates but there are so many gorgeous tops out now that i decided to return since summer is winding down i do recommend This is an adorable top that i find to be extremely comfortable i dont usually buy prints but this one is so feminine and looks great with dark wash jeans i am a 36d and the medium was a perfect fit I am pregnant and i thought this would be a great sleep bra its soft and fits okay but it has zero support or shape i would only buy if you are a b cup or smaller and can get away without support if i would have seen this is the store i would have passed over it however i was too lazy to return so i am wearing it its comfortable so thats a redeeming quality i would not recommend for larger chested ladies though This tank fit well and i loved the ruffle in the back and how it layed but the front was not a good look and i will be retuning it I got this in the petite length size o and it fit just right i like that i didnt have to have it altered in the length can wear with flats with plenty of clearance to the floor from the bottom hem my only beef with the design is the height of the waist i personally think that the elastic waistband looks cheap and really needs to be concealed with a belt yet because it sits so high literally right under the bustline its a tricky one to pull off i have a wide belt that sort of does th Ive been looking for bralettes that provide some support but not bindingtight for night time and casual wear this is a light weight bra could be a little more supportive pretty color with nice lines only downside is the retailer tag on the back itchy i need to remove it This dress is simply beautiful and stunning it is so figure flattering and i cant wait to wear it size small worked for me and since im tall it fell right to my ankle which is perfect for me i could not be happier with the purchase and the keyhole in the back is a beautiful detail 3 tags sewn in 2 small about 1 long and 1 huge about 2 x 3 very itchy so i cut them out then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags not comfortable at all also i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work i am a b cup however this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup so for me this would only be a lounging bralette if it wasnt so itchy I recently got this on sale after looking at it forever on my wish list im so happy with it its very comfortable and just long enough for my torso 53 the pattern on the front is very flattering Very comfortable shirt light weight top with lovely floral colors great for springsummer with white jeans love everything one september makes Loved this top and was really happy to find it on sale Beautiful top but delicate i wore it to school and the straps on my backpack caused some pilling other than that it is beautiful and vibrant just make sure you arent doingwearing anything that will rub it continuously since the fabric is delicate Just received this in the mail tried it on and am smitten im usually a l but sometimes im a xl if no stretch in retailer tops i bought this one in l and im sure glad i did very flowy stretchy and comfortable i also bought the meda lace top from one september and they are very similar expect this is more of a tshirt and the other is more of a blouse i almost think i couldve gotten a m in this because there is a lot of extra fabric at the chest which is usually never the issue for me Love this top i kept eyeing it online and wavering on size since my postbaby body is a little wonky i went with the xsp and miraculously it works perfectly so i would say it does run just a little large i love the length and usually do not go with petite sizes at retailer because i like the longer lengths of the regular but this is perfect on me and there is give up top so it looks lovely and it is very soft and comfortable this will be a goto top this season I really loved this top online and wanted to love it in person it is soft and the patter is okay in person the neckline is higher than i am used to also there are two buttons in the back that must be unbuttoned in order to wear the top it is difficult to button them behind your neck with the top on unfortunately i had to return this item I really wanted this to work alas it had a strange fit for me the straps would not stay up and it had a weird fit under the breast it worked standing up but the minute i sat down it fell off my shoulders the fabric was beautiful and i loved that it had pockets This top is so cute but it is massively babydoll shaped a line which is not apparent from the pictures i measured the xs i have and the chest is about 42 and sweep is over 70 i would definitely keep this top if it hung straighter the craftsmanship is lovely and fabric is so natural and handwoven looking im thinking about asking my tailor if she can take the sides in but that might ruin it as the fabric layout is cut and proportioned to this swing style Why do designers keep making crop tops i cant imagine this would be flattering on anyone especially someone average height and well endowed on top i looked like a football player the pattern and fabric are gorgeous so if you are like 4 tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work i am between a 68 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top such a weird cut there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s I have a short torso and this works well for me 34c bought the 0 theres not much stretch to the fabric so it is fitted to my chest but not in an uncomfortable way definitely doesnt hang and have extra fabric like on the model zipper goes almost all the way down to the bottom so its easier to get on and off which makes up for the lack of stretch n the fabric unlike another reviewer i found it went really well with navy pants and i wore it to a business meeting under a blazer wi I love this top it is loose and comfortable it is not sheer so you dont need a cami it runs a little large so size down if you want a more tailored fit 1 criticism it catches on sharp jewelry or belts and can pull if you are not careful I passed up this dress so many times in the store and finally tried it on today because i wanted a casual dress while traveling in the cape i was surprised how much cuter it is on than on hanger i sized down to get a more fitting look and really made a difference for me in style i was not a fan of the way it looked so loose on model it looks really cute fitted and a bit sexy even it is lined and very comfy and can be dressed up a but for work with a cardi i believe i will get a lot of wear I am so drawn to baby doll and boxy shirts so i immediately tried this on in the store i am petite and only 52 so usually shirts with a lot of fabric swallow me whole but this one was still cute there is a lot more fabric than the picture lets on but i think it is still super cute and flattering i would definitely check the size chart and read comments to see if someone with your same size description has recommended a specific size for your body type i am petite and weigh about 110 lbs I would have loved this dress if the bust and waist were just a little more fitted i am 32c and the top was too big fit perfectly on hips the lace material means it can not be easily altered so i chose to return the dress i would have definitely kept it if it were a better fit The zipper broke on this piece the first time i wore it very disappointing since i love the design im actually going to try to replace the zipper myself with something stronger but annoying that its come to that I usually size up with this brand small was perfect for me at 135lbs this top has a luxurious but casual feel and beautiful i am obsessed and want to wear it everyday it wears a little long and drapey but a little tight where it rolls up in the arms This dress is adorable its a perfect casual look for summer and the quality is nice with the lining though still overpriced in my opinion the tie detail is somewhat adjustable and i found my normal size s to fit fine 57 128 where this gets me is the fact that its dry cleantotally doesnt make sense for a dress that is essentially a fancy tshirt for summer i might bring it back for that alone since i originally planned to wear it a lot I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit im 51 112lbs so dress hit rt below knee will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming this dress looks stunning on great vibrant color i have dark hair makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish when i tried it on in store salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it i did and am glad i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte Loved this top great design comfortable and unique soft material The rest of the reviewers are right about the color being in accurately pictured i ordered the dark orange color and i recieved more of a dark cedar brown colored jacket the print is great i love it its so different than any other jackets ive seen while the jacket is ã¼ber cute it is a bit bulky though the waist tie helps with that and its not heavy winter appropriate its not waterproof or heavily insulated for your average winter day though it will be a fun option the removable v I purchased this top in an antro store last week the quality is wonderful and the greenish blue color is very unique the blouse has a beautiful stretchy camsiole that is attached at the shoulders but can be removed by snaps i tooks great when worn two different ways i wore it with the campole out and it peeks through the blouse at the bottom it also looks great when the camisole is worn in my only wish is that it would come in a petite size as its a touch big at the shoulders and neckli I received this shirt in my typical xs and it fits perfectly im not crazy in love with it but i also dont dislike the shirt is on the thin side do i need to wear a cami underneath it no my concern is holes it does remind me of a material that could develop some holes after some wear and washes with that being said ill wash this shirt in cold water and hang dry and hopefully that will prevent holes from developing the length is fine and i do like the slits in frontit adds a little dim I was really hoping to like this but it did not look the way it does on the model at least not on me the sharkbite hem is much more pronounced and looser the one in the photo looks like it was pinned back i am 58 and usually wear a medium or large i got a medium and there was a lot more material on the bottom half than the photo shows it made me look bigger and was not flattering material has a nice weave but its thin and delicate i bought the holly deep olive and the blue colors I tried this on from the sale section and they only had a 2 i usually do 0 and surprisingly that size was the right fit it is fitted with just enough room to eat te blue is a light blue almost neutral with the white embroidery i think it looked stylish and decided to keep it the peplum part hit just in the right spot i am short petite but my torso is normal size I debated n that as i think it looks loose on the model but if i was to tighten it it looks a lot more flattering i tried on the xs in the store i usually do that to decide if i need petite and it looked huge when we pinched the back to see if xxs would work it was a lot of fabric and looser didnt look as good on me but i like the dress overall so still recommend and for those who like the looser look this is great i would however order eptite for 515 115 lbs 03 dd che Really cute piece but its huge i ordered an xxs petite and it was unfortunately extremely wide and not flattering returning I bought this top online in the burnt orange color and was so excited to get it when i tried it on the fit was fine but it just lackedsomething the back was a little bit too long the front was a little bit too short and it lacked the overall tailored look that i was after gorgeous fabric and top but not for me i wanted something more for 150 bought the velvet tunic instead I love cute summer dresses and this one especially because it is made out of linen is unique it is very wellmade with a design that is quite flattering i am 5 foot 6 and a little curvy with a 38 c bust and i got a size 10 it fits well although it is difficult to zip up because the material has no give the perfect dress to wear to italy or france now i just have to book my tickets This top is so much prettier in real life than it is on the model the pattern and texture are both lovely and the peplum is surprisingly flattering it is definitely on the short side but i think that gives it a modern look the fabric does not stretch at all but i still think it fits tts if you have a very large chest you may want to go up a size but otherwise i would order your normal size This shirt caught my eye because of how beautiful it was i love the shape design and and the color its perfect for spring and summer with some white pants unfortunately i dont see any possibilities for this shirt to be worn any other way so far it doesnt work with any of my jeans skirts or shorts i usually prefer items with more versatility for outfits so im still on the fence if im going to keep it or not with that aside it seriously is a great quality shirt with a beautiful Purchased this top online and when i received it was very pleased it has and elegant cut and yet is a casual fabric love that the sleeves run longerads to the overall look also loved the v necklineenhances the feel of the overall style with various necklaces this top has limitless options the color states mosswhich i usually think of as greenish browni found it to be more of a taupe would have liked it to have a green tones however it is still a fantastic f I usually wear a medium and bought a small it fit ok but had no shape and was not flattering i love baby doll dresses and tops but this was a tent my daughter saw me try it on and said thats a piece of tablecloth its going back I was very excited to order this top in red xs so cute but it was huge shapeless and support thin it had to go back i shouldve looked at other reviews I am in need of easy comfortable tops for everyday wear i bought this top mostly because of the cute buttons when i received it it looked exactly as it does in the picture online however the buttons kept slipping out of their homes because the holes were slightly too big the shirt fit but was just a tad snug near the upper arms which would stretch and loosen up throughout the day its definitely a comfortable shirt but it felt more like a pajama top its going back At first i wasnt sure about it the neckline is much lower and wavy than i thought but after wearing it it really is comfortable it stretches a lot so i wear a cami underneath so when i lean forward im not showing the world my torso I find that this brand can be a little bit allovertheplace with sizes had i tried this on in person i may have bought it in a small instead of a m despite being a bit big it still looks great and hides my flaws well i bought a m in another shirt from them the seamed scoop neck and that shirt was a full 2 inches smaller in the bust than this just something to keep in mind still a great shirt love the neutral color This top is absolutely stunning i purchased the white one just received and it fits nicelya little on the big side but i believe it looks better that way this will look great with everything it is well constructed and looks very unique love it The fabric felt cheap and i didnt find it to be a flattering top for reference i am wearing a medium in the photos and my measurements are 383040 Runs big and looked unflattering i am petite might work on someone taller I bought this lovely silkvelvet shirt in the quotskyquot color but it is more on the teal blue side than sky blue which disappointed me it is definitely darker than appears in photo still a luxurious wellmade beauty with sassy appeal it drapes like a snake slithering down your body it comes with attitude Was so excited to order this beautiful shirt and the color sky is gorgeous but as another reviewer saidit runs small it was also way too short so sadly i will be returning this i gave it 5 stars because it is beautiful and great qualityit just didnt fit me I ordered ivory in xl because this brand tends to run tight if youre well endowed its a beautiful color and i love the contrasting plaid lining the inside of the collar and cuffs havent decided about keeping it because it looks oversized but cozy and its really long it almost touches the top of my knees in back sooooo pretty though The shirt is exactly as it is pictured i have the burnt orange color and love it i received numerous compliments both paired with jeans and tucked into a fun skirt it fits true to size as i normally wear a small in all retailer however it is the slightest bit tight in the shoulders i would give this top a 55 Perfect dress for hot humid sticky weather This is so thin and poor quality especially for the price it felt like a thin pajama top the buttons are terrible little shell buttons this could not have been returned faster I didnt end up keeping this dressit just wasnt right for me it is very cute and fit well but the fabric was very thin partially lined which is a plus and the hem line coming up on the sides made it just too short for me i ordered the petite xs and liked the length in front and back well but the side slitvent was just too high for my liking the tie part hit at the perfect spot for me at only 54 118 i guess i just didnt love it and would rather save my funds for something i ca I read the first review on this and ordered both a small and a medium as i thought this would run small i have to totally disagree with the reviewer i find that this top runs true to size or even generous the sky color is so pretty and this top can be dressed up with some nice heels and a necklace or it can be comfy casual i usually wear a small in hh brand and this one was true to fit 52 broad shoulders 120 lb This dress is comfortable and stylish at the same time it runs true to size im 51 113 lbs and got the xs petite wore it once so far for a few hours and got a few compliments on it The designshape of the dress are quite flattering flirty and feminine but there is no way that the dress i received is new the color is a faded washed out red and there are black stains all over the belt area there is no tag the fabric looks droopy and laundered and is not crisp stiff or new i am very disappointed by the quality of the item that i received undoubtedly this one is going back dear retailer please make sure that you do not send preowend clothing articles to This one totally worked for me love the color length and style Prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress it definitely needs heels im 54 120 34d and this is a size 36 i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff This is the perfect summer dress it can be dressed up or down the quality of the linen fabric is very nice im 51 and it hit right below my knees i found it to run true to size those with a smaller bust might want to go down a size but the tie in the front can be adjusted its lovely First the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer i really wanted to like this top but the fitting is so awkward for me i typically where a 0xs and sized up in the shirt to a size 2 it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest size 32a i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow need a strapless bra and made it look unflattering overall had to return this one back to the store The color is perfect for fall and into winter only the inside collar on the photo shows the subtle plaid lining the lining was an unexpected bonus and adds even more dimension to the shirt if the sleeves are turned up the fit is true to size and the stressed velvet fabric is current for this season im going to enjoy wearing this shirt The perfect striped tshirt and the cute little buttons down the front are a wonderful accent with each one being different i love it Great look and you can wear this vest with almost everything i normally wear a small but they only had mediums and it fit fine i like it tied this will stay in my closet all year round it does look like it will wrinkle easily but that doesnt bother me a must buy This is a great pull over dress that can easily be dressed to wear to work to a bbq or to happy hour i have a large chest which sometimes makes this fit look like a tent but this fabric drapes nicely the only thing i would note is the neckline was slightly higher on me than for the model After reading the previous reviews i ordered a size larger i am so glad i did it it fits perfectly i am 5411532dd and went with the s regular so beautiful i cant wait to wear it I was so excited to try out this top since it was such a bargain and neutral unfortunately the shape is a line and accentuates the hip area a bit more than i find flattering so it will be returned Like others reviewers mentioned on here this dress is extremely well made but there were too many cons for me as well this would most certainly work on a petiteshorter frame but for tall busty and curvier girls it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out however im a 36c and found that the armshoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top there was entirel I read the previous reviews and had hoped that the exclamations about the color being inaccurate were exaggerated however they are sadly very true let me be clear that this is a beautiful comfortable piece of clothing when you put it on it feels thick and of very good quality and while the pattern is interesting and pretty the dark orange color i was expecting is actually a mud brown i think its unfortunate that retailer misrepresented such a key element of the jacket but i digress the This coat is beautiful i love the color and the design it definitely runs a little large i usually wear a small or a zero and i can wear a small wth a large sweater underneath no problem i might have wanted an extra small but i just stuck with the small because i needed the coat already the vest keeps it warm but the sleeves arent lined so its cold unless you have a nice sweater underneath it if youre going to be in cold weather Nice vest pretty olive color hangs nice butits just kinda funny just hangs and really looks odd when tied i like the laying piece just wished it had more umph This top is super comfy and casual the slitdesign in the front gives it more of a stylish look than your average white long sleeve tee would definitely recommend Intrepid soul that i am i washed it in the machine in cold water on a 25 minute cycle then put it in the dryer for 8 minutes shook it out hung it up and it is just the same as when it went in doesnt need to be ironed and didnt shrink yes the swing is vast but that is part of its charm pair it with a fitted piece on the bottom and no one will think that you are actually needing that much material to cover anything i think it is fun something i will use for years wonderfully comfort Its ok fit doesnt wow me because of my body chest is too wide hips look too narrow drapes across my back fat in an especially nonflattering way basically made my squareapple body look more squareapple great part about this dress is that its comfy and hides the tummy pooch construction is poorly donecontrasting liner at vneck is rolling out on one side only and then doing the same at the hem contralaterally another negative point is dry clean only boo im 53 140 392835 an In my retailer this was hung over in the pj section and it really has more of a jammie top feel soft thin and stretchy its super cozy and comfortable and it drapes really nice mine seems to have stretched out a little especially the neckline and the little buttons have a hard time staying closed im happy with it though for what it is a great casual day t I love this vest there are so many ways to style itopen or tied closed over a dress or with a tshirt and jeans i get compliments every time i wear it its soft and light enough to add interest to an outfit without being too heavyhot to wear all day This blouse is a perfect creation perfectweight cotton many many details and color all perfectly executed theres fullness to the body so this will definitely be easy to wear in hot humid locations this summer and it would be easy to pair with many things you have already for a casual yet collected look theres no mistaking quality when you look at this piece i bought the medium for my 130 34f size 8 blousetee frame this is the blouse you will have for years and you will enjoy Love this vest the color looks a little more brown in the picture than it really isits a deep forest green that goes great with jeans or black pants a great piece for polished but casual style and the fabric has a nice soft suedelike finish if only the was slightly higher to hit my true natural waist it would get that fifth star but sometimes i wear petite sizes so that might be the issue herestill looks good tied I received the sky color in m online am definetly keeping it as it is beautiful however i wish they had made it a little less wide and more long i am 5 3 and could totally size down to a s but even at my height it would be too short i like crop tops and waist hitting tops a lot but the shortness on this one just looks like it shrunk in the dryer I am obsessed with peplum down coats because the ones you usually see have no shape and are extremely unflattering i was excited for this to arrive this is quite nice and it looks more feminine than the other down coats out there the coat itself runs just true to my shirt size but not what i want for a coat i will be returning this for a size up because i will want to wear a sweater or at least maybe a thicker shirt under this especially for winter or fall the fabric is decent and the weigh The silhouette and length of this skirt and length are flattering classic and comfortable the colors and weight of this skirt make it versatile could be worn yearround so long as its not 100 degrees out there is a bit of weight to it its one of my favorite pieces in my closet can be styled 20 different ways pair with a higherend tee tank denim jacket or bodyhugging sweater i sized down Perfect for work or going out i layered this with the reversible tank in medium pink so it would be work appropriate it did not feel scratchy to me maybe because i layered it great buy especially with the discounts feel like i lucked out Its a pretty top but it runs very short the back is also pretty see through so im not sure i will keep it its called off the shoulder but it is so tight when you try and actually wear it off the shoulder great design just not sure i will keep it due to length Iim not usually big on lace but this is so unique and versatile that i went for it looks good dressed up wa nice top or casual wa tee can be worn practically all year love it My firned tried this on and her first comment was take it off it is scratchy so i didnt bother trying it on it is however beautiful if you are not sensitive to scratchy material fit was true to size The stylist had me try this top on off the shoulders but that was kind of snug perhaps why it didnt fit right it is not off the shoulders on this picture the cut is loose so it looked big on me but going smaller would not have worked the way i had it on may give it another try on xs was big so would need to try the xxs next time but off the shoulders looked nice on the lady who was smaller built next to me colors are nice light but appropriate for fall or summer light fabri Some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side but for me it was big too bad the smaller size is sold out well all peittes are sold out the length is also pretty long below the knee but in the narrow part stillso able to keep it the colors are great i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists adn they all loved it and told me to keep it winner for sure I purchased this skirt at retailer store in texas i fell in love since i saw it the fabric is nice and the colors are pretty and cheerful for this springsummer and it has pockets on the sides dont we love pockets very practical and lightweight This is a very pretty skirt and the colors are better in real life sizing was mostly true to size for me slightly tight in the waist but i have a thicker waist compared to my hips im 57 and 138 and ordered a size 4 i usually size up to a 6 with retailer pencil skirts a 6 probably would have fit as well especially in the waist but didnt want it too big in the hips length was perfect to my knees This skirt is wonderful the price point seems a bit high for the average office gal but the quality is impeccable i really enjoy looking at myself in the mirror when wearing this skirt it can be dressed up dressed down worn during all seasons the designpattern is artsy and whimsical without being too outthere unless you want it to be of course the fit is true to size and the delicate details are just lovely Like other reviewers noted the pics dont do this skirt justice it is truly beautiful with an intricate lace pattern and rich colors cant wait to wear this to work Love this skirt the detail is amazing runs small i ordered a 12 im usually a 10 but still a little snug Not keeping this one the fabric is a bit tackylooking in person the cut is odd and its just not me fit is fine and there are snaps to keep the neckline flat and shaped the colors are as shown and it is a good length falls to top of hip i simply did not like it too metallic looking maybe The top as with most of aps tops is well stitched material is very uncomfortable if you have large bust it is a little divulging this may prompt you to wear something underneath to look modest and change the shape of the top I love the metallic colors of this top and figured i could wear it under a ruched jacket and circle skirt for work welp thats out the window this design is poor for one this is not a piece for a petite woman with no torso and i dont know how anyone with a longer torso wears t his this hits above my belly botton on and i got apetite 2 i have no torso so without a jacket i would never wear this its very low cutthe back is very lowits a little loose but i run between a 2 and a 4 This top is so much better in person i do not agree with some of the other reviews about the fabric being scratchy it is not and i have sensitive skin i love this top and have got lots of compliments This is a lovely pencil skirt that is wellmade and really brightens a work day like a lot skirts with multiple colors a lot of tops feel like they should match but you have to try a few that really work with the skirt and your look to get the right impact So disappointed that no where in the limiting did it mention this suit is australian in size i ordered the 10 im usually an 8 but that was sold out and the suit arrives and doesnt even fir over my hips the label clearly says 10 australian us 6 gutted that i have to return this suit because of this sizing issue the suit looks to be well made and the design is adorable of it only for I saw this top online and read the reviews so i passed when i went into the store when i went in again i thought i would give it a try so glad i did it fits great and is way way prettier in person i ended up buying it and so glad i did This is a very pretty top with vibrant metallic colors i would be perfect for a holiday party or going out to dinner it wasnt as scratchy as i thought it would be based on the reviews however it ran a little big im 53 and about 130 pounds and i almost always wear a size 6 but the six was too big id recommend sizing down it was also lower cut than i thought it would beshowed a lot of cleavage im a 34d so its not work appropriate Love everything about this beautiful coat except the way it fits on me it is just perfect in the shoulders but once it flares out at the bottom i look like a clown costume if i size down it will not fit in my shoulders perhaps a tailor can install buckles that match the neckline buckle to the sides of the coat to fold in the flare on another note the buckle at the neckline feels very hard and fake not sure if its real leather The title says it allthis fabric of this top is both the best and worst part of the design the colors are vibrant and the combination of materials shoulder is a knit sweaterlike navy fabric is interesting however that is where the positive comments end on this one the top is so scratchy stiff and frankly uncomfortable i can not imagine wanting to wear it it could benefit from a lining and that might have solved the problem of scratchy itchy fabric the stiff fabric of the bo My usual size 6 fits perfectly yes the metallic fibers on the inside are scratchy a cami solves that problem when ordering i realized i cld not go strapless wld have to wear a one of my wider strap camis in navy or black to cover the bra strap area it was obvious some sort of coverup swtr or jacket wb needed wld cover the strap area anyway so i also ordered the fauxfur cardi in the ivory to wear over this top its a shruglike cardi w 34 slvs comes in the plum also if you The online picture does not do this skirt justice its very pretty and unique in design i think it should be worn with a tighter shirt that is tucked in unlike the picture this is truly a pretty pencil skirt I bought this and like other reviews agree that the quality probably could be better but i still love it enough to keep the buckle fell apart but i was able to fix it and the zipper seems a little weak it has pilled but the fabric is textured so i didnt even notice until i read the other reviews and then looked back at my jacket it is a perfect medium coat for 40s 50s before i am ready to bust out my ugly down north face for winter i get compliments every time i wear it love I bought a petite size 2 i am 53 111 lb it fit perfect with a tiny bit of room looks just like the one pictured length on me was about 1 inch lower than the model very bright with multiple colors has a nice stretch very cute This will be perfect for the mild fall weather in texas its light weight and i love that the top is a little more fitted and the bottom swings out I love the dresses by maeve and this one is no exception i was pleasantly surprised upon receiving this dress because i wasnt sure about the print size and colors when i saw it online but the print is beautiful its a very simple but elegant style and the ruffle on the back adds an extra touch of interest i like that it has enough coverage at the top front and back the underarms do not fall very low and it is lined the aline skirt will flatter most body types the fabric and overall q These pants are fun i use them as sleep pants i had to size up because the waist band was a little tight for comfort I ordered this in xs im 54 around 115lbs and it fits perfectly the material is very soft but not seethrough and the romper is wellmade i wish it came in other colours id buy more I purchased these for something other than sweats to wear for a girls get away weekend they were so comfortable and flattering friends told me i could wear them out for dinner the fabric is beautiful and i loved the way they draped the angled cut on the legs is very cute and something a bit different these could be perfect for a hot summer evening dinner because the fabric is very light and breezy dress it up with a tank top and ballet flats and youre good to go Love this cream sleeveless topit goes with everything and you can dress it up or down this will be a go to top all summer long and probably wear thru the fall as well with a layered sweater if needed i typically wear small or medium size and got the medium hoping for a little longer length i am 57 34c and overall wt of approx 128 lbsit fits very nicely thank you retailer This skirt is beautiful especially the color and looks well made however i am very pear shaped and this skirt is just too straight to be flattering on me i agree that it runs small but even when i sized up it still wasnt flattering i imagine that those who were not bestowed with massive hips will look lovely in this Happy with this top slightly thinner material than i was expecting but thatll be fine with our hot summers got the navy striped one very pretty and extremely soft washes well i do wear an tank underneath though bc the armholes are slightly large and you can see part of my bra Love the fit of this sweater it almost fits like a sweatshirt and definitely not as long as on the model it hits me just below the hips for ref im 53 im considering getting all the other colors because its so cute and comfortable could be dressed up or down runs true to sizeim always a small and this fits perfectly roomy I love this sweater i like sweaters that are narrow on top and taper out so it doesnt look like a sack on me plus it is the perfect weight i wish i would have bought one in a different color because it is so comfortable The colors are vivid and perfectly autumnal but the fit is a mess it was overall too large the waistline curves up in the front and then falls into small pleats which was maternityish the waistband was thicker than the dress and sat away from my body and the material was a cheapish poly had the outer dress been made from the same material as the lining i would have liked it better the modesty closure was a plus but the dress was already unraveling when i took it out returned Love this tunic i am a curvy gal with a few extra curves in the middle and this is a perfect top for accentuating the good and masking the negative i purchased the pink color and it is a gorgeous peachy pink a much deeper color than what is portrayed in the picture i found it true to size typically i wear a medium or large depending on the structure and the medium fit well a little more fitted on top and looser around the waist i came back to buy another in the ivory but alas it is Loved the green color the cut is super flattering but alas i do need hte petite ti was a bit long and i looked a little lost unfrotuantely the color is sold out in petite But i thought this was lace or with texture it is more a pattern on regular fabric colors are nice there are subtle flowers with bright colors in the pattern the fit is nice the 0p fit snugly enough i dont think there was much give but that was comfortable enough petite length did end below the knee as shown i think it would have been nicer shorter but dont want to have to pay extra to ehm so i left that one behindmaybe on sale I like this sweater so much i just bought it in a second color the pleats make the sweater conform to my shape just enough to be flattering i wore it over three different dresses this week that might have felt too bare for work or cooler weather i live in a hot climate so this is the right weight for our cooler months the metallic threads give it a little bit of flair and the grey color goes with everything im 57 size 1012 and the large fit just right Beautiful color great quality and great fit if you size up i learned my lesson with previous purchases and sized up when i read it runs small i usually wear a 02 and i took a risk and went for the 4 it fits perfectly i have a 25 in waist Online this looks like a great sweater i ordered an xxsp and found that this sweater is much wider in the middle than pictured in fact im pretty sure they pinned the shirt in the back for the picture to make it appear slimmer unfortunately this sweater will not work for me as i am an hourglass shape and this shirt makes me look 20 pounds heavier I was worried about this item when i ordered it because of how it looks in the picture but i had wishful thinking i should have gone with my gut this shirt does not have the same quality as all my other retailer purchases it is seethrough and flimsy the bottom is just like the picture it hangs in an odd rumpled way the top is very flattering though so its a shame if the bottom fit nicer like their other products i could have gotten away with wearing a cami under it to make up for the qu This skirt is a great length and nice piece for fallwinter i love the color it fits like a high waisted skirt would which is why i purchased the next size up This easel caftan is simply amazing the silhouette fits all sizes and shapes while providing a unique dress Just came today the print is gorgeous very bohemian its a dressier dress with the chiffon on the con side the chiffon is very delicate snagged easily while trying on theres raw edges on the waistband needed trimming fresh out of the package sz 10 fit in the waist too small for 36d bust sz 12 fits bust but is big in the waist sz 10 ankle length for 57 12 hits the floor havent decided if ill keep the 12 and try to alter My waist measures 28 and the size 4 is a snug fit i normally buy size 2 in retailer skirts but the 2 was unbearably tight cute skirt though i like that its machine washable and the quality looks good I love the fabric and color i bought the green one my only complaint is that the base is wider than the picture shows it looks more fitted on the model it is more of an a shape significantly wider at the hips I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately its going back because the knit is just too thin i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but its not and because its so light the swing effect doesnt really come off nothing special I love the color of this skirt and the fabric is wonderful it was a bit longer than anticipated but fit well Dress ran very large in every way beautiful design lining and quality material i should have sized down 2 sizes item is now sold out Finally a swing top that doesnt look like a sack on me ive been wanting to partake of this current style but everything ive tried so far just looks dumpy on me not this top it is very feminine and flattering i am 57 118 lbs and have a small waist and although this is a swing style it still shows my waist and doesnt overpower me it is also a lovely fabric especially in the soft pink which i got im thinking of going back for more colors I bought this shirt in the neutral and white and love it so many people compliment it i usually pair it with white pants and cute wedges to dress it up obviously with a statement necklace too but the greatest thing about this shirt is the fact that you can also dress it down the material is fabulous but i have not washed it yet so i am not sure if it is going to shrink which i hope it doesnt because it is one of my favorite pieces unlike the other reviewer i did not think that the Unlike the other reviewers i did not have any problem with the sizing fit or length of this skirt it is a midi skirt so i think its suppose to be a little bit longer for me it fit true to size for reference i am 58 135 pounds and the size 6 fit perfectly i think the color is beautiful and the quality is good For a now feel that comfy and well made this was a great choice This skirt looks exactly as pictured and fits great i purchased it a few weeks ago and got lots of compliments on it however on the third wear the side zipper split wide open needless to say it was returned Dang i got a small and was still swimming in it its made of the fabric that increasingly seems to be the fabric of choice for all things tshirty soft and thinish a bit translucent id rather wait for something more formfitting and flattering back it went Bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost fabric feels cheap like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly did not flatter the female form felt like a burlap sack gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag returned it Nice weight sweater that allows one to wear leggings or ultra skinny jeans without looking like im pregnant not that theres anything wrong with that very feminine and light weight enough to wear with a cami underneath and a pretty scarf I loved this top it reminded me of one i have from retailer from circa 2008 in black and white however on this one the chest area is too big in both the 14 and 16 and i even found myself tugging downward on the fabric to keep it in place because the waist is elastic and also too big i probably need a size 12 but then i fear it would be too shortwaisted on me for i am 510 unfortunately it is not for me also the sleeves are much bigger and flouncier than they appear in the photo on t I love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist i am normally a 810 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable the quality is ok something i feel i would see at another type of discount store for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus Great shirt to wear with white pants and wedges im a teacher and this is perfect for warmer months for school or for casual evening out it runs big but falls in such a way that it doesnt make the wearer look big it falls elegantly and in a flattering way great versatile shirt I loved this skirt on but just the other reviewers it runs small in the waist throwing off the dimension of the skirt i ended up getting the 0 despite the fact that it was tighter in the waist because the 2 at this length with my height and amount of material became overwhelming on me it would have looked better in a slightly shorter cut as another reviewer stated as well Gorgeous top very nice detail work soft and flattering i dont think its too full on the bottom at all mine has a loose but pretty straight silhouette word of warning soft pink is not pink it is peach with some pink and definitely not my color if peach isnt flattering on you heed this and other reviewers comments they are weighing correctly i will have to either return for the white or dye the fabric myself to a more flattering shade bummer that i thought the other reviewers might Love the fabric of this shirt even though it was thinner than i expected it is soft to the skin and flattering however i returned it because it is made for women with long torso and shorter shoulders I have already worn this several times it is very flattering lightweight and easy to wear dressy but also very soft and comfortable Very pretty fabric and beautiful color but i agree with the other reviewer here the fit is a bit strange the waist is very small need to size up at least one size for that to fit while the rest fits nicely its also a little longer than i had expectedsort of looks like it should be a couple inches shorter and im 511 I was so excited about the arrival of my maza dress much to my surprise the material was not has structured as i thought it would be from the photos the fit was very tight and did not fall as nicely as i anticipated because i loved the classic design i decided to give it another chance so i returned it for the next size up and fell in love the open sleeve was a nice surprise with a touch if elegance the front buttons added a bit of old charm and feminine appeal while the material was not v Im 54 130 lbs 34 d i bought the medium i think i could have gotten the small but i didnt have time to reorder it fit fine but could have been a little more snug around my top half i love the length and the fabric The skirt that i received had very little blue or green in it and was mostly white yellow and some red the fit was fine but the quality for the price was not there for me the lack of quality and the disappointment in the quality equals a return Ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception looks just like the pictures colorscutdrape with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep vneck sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff this dress does not stretchthe bodice felt very fitted and tight especially at the waist band runs tts or small if youre bustybroad shouldered size up it has a dreadful side zip is fully lined and all synthetic fabric boo i purchased size 10p my stats 36c382735135 Bought a large could barely pull up over my butt runs extremely small its cute but if your not a stick figure this is not the suit for you Adorable too chilly now to wear alone too cute to cover it up my navy parka or jean jacket will prob be ok w it though size 6 fits me perfectly looks pretty much on me as in the pic love plaid cotton blend tops anyways ruffles adorable im not too big on that but do love this look when i first removed this top from the packaging it had an odd smokylike odor but its the dye i think after hanging it for a few days the smell disappeared i have in mind to wear w the pilcr This dress makes you feel like a bohemian goddess falls in the right area and absolutely adorable the dress is very fragile handle with care This is my new favorite top looks and fits as described Last minute i needed a familyfriendly top for a chilly night so i tried on a couple of flowy sweaters at retailer and this was the keeper while i found other styles a bit too boxy or bulky for my short torso this has a nice aline shape that gave me a slim profile while still being forgiving plus the detail up top is feminine and i liked not having fabric piled up around my neck i am usually a small but wanted this to fit like the model so i sized up to a medium and voila i am a model just Love all the colors in this skirt and that i can wear it with a tee and flat sandals or a black jacket and heels easy piece to wear many ways great quality too This tunic trumped any other i have seen this season the style with the delicate open stitchwork around the upper chest gave it quite a feminine appeal i especially love the weight of the fabric being on the light side wont have to worry about hot flashes like when wearing a thicker fabric its warm without being bulky and to top it off it was on sale and i was able to grab two colors this tunic is also age appropriate and flattering for most anyone extraordinary to say the least I needed a dress that was easy to throw on for summer days and this dress is perfect for that its flattering light weight and unique ive received a handful of compliments while wearing this dress i am 5 6 150 lbs hourglass figure and typically purchase a small or medium 810 and chose a small for this dress id say its still loose on me which is what i prefer the scoop neck and cut out allows you wear a normal bra however ive noticed im more comfortable wearing a camisole or s The inseam is advertised as 28 but they are more like 38 i was hoping they were for short people but they are for someone with very long legs event in my tallest heels id have to get them hemmed just a warning to my short friends out there the quality fit look was great but way way way too long I love paige brand pantsthey are soft comfortable and forgiving i love these and want them badly the are still tight all the way to the knee and then go out into a flattering flareit is difficult to find the perfect fit on something like thisand paige has done a wonderful job for my body my store does not carry petite so i tried these on in regular length they were significantly too long for me 53 probably 34 inches to long i am hoping for a sale so i can buy them in petite for This top is really pretty and nice quality runs big i went down a size and its perfect coloring is more subtle in person than in the photo So i love pilcro i wear them all the time and usually size down because they grow after wearing them i tried on my usual size in these and felt like they are too tight not sure if they will get any looser the material feels really good lightweight and the stripes are subtle but cute not sure if ill keep them or maybe size up This is a cute top with jeans for spring and summer or warmer climates very fresh and airy the fabric hangs nicely and although it is lightweight it is not too thin or see through ii does not get overly wrinkled either the style is flattering for most body types and it can be dressed up or down the v neck is just right not too deep that you feel like you are showing too much cleavage but deep enough to be feminine and slimming i normally wear a size s in retailer tops and blouses Petite pants hsould be able to fit short peple but a 32 inch inseam on pants with buttons at the nottom cant even gegt them hemmed what a bummer my inseam is 27 inchess so i would need a 5 inch heel otherwise gorgeous and waiat fits true to size thighs a bit snug for musclea but stretchy enough to fit thinking about keeping them but have to find big plaform heeks I tried on the petite size in my usual xs adn i actually have to go down to xxs i looked overtaken by the shirt im 52 and 115lbs cut is flowy and not close to the body sleeves are narrower but still ok with athletic built color light one is great for gals with darker complexion and hair but for my pale self the darker one was better but cant go wrong i ordered both colors and liked both of them ruffle is a great addition too I tried these on on a whim because i liked the shirt that they were displayed with in the store and was surprised how much i liked them they are a great lighter weight alternative to the pilcro hyphen chino great for hot days of summer the subtle vertical stripes go with everything and help elongate the leg overall a really flattering cut the waist is not too low and does not create muffin top The shirt is absolutely cute looking but thats just thatlooks im 52 size 6 wears m to l top i tried on the medium in the store it was rather flowing i liked it but i didnt like how it fit on the underarm area it hung very low so i ordered a petite m still the same plus the store the lighting was dark so i didnt realize how see through the shirt was too had to return it These jeans i tried these on in addition to the high rise paige denim and these won out hands down classic flattering fit from mother with an element of edginess with the frayed hem these are long enough on me im 55 to cuff at the ankle if i dont want a distressed look on a particular day they are slightly stretchy like other mother denim but not so much that i would size down i have muscular calves and thighs but someone who does not could likely size down and be happy with the a I ordered this top in my usual size and am exchanging it for one size smaller it runs very generous and so the sizing is a little off the style and quality are beautiful so i am anxious to receive the smaller size The blush stripes are subtle but they definitely give elongating effect to your legs very comfortable pair of crop pants but my calves are definitely feeling tight in there I got a small mauve the fit is great and the length is perfect for me just few inches above my knees cute and cozy what more can i aske for I have a similar pair of capris from retailer and when i ordered these i thought they were the same in a different color these are less flattering and i may not keep them Fun detail with the beading and lace arms are a little longer while the body of the sweatshirt is a little shorter than expected but thats the style of the piece the fit was tts with those proportions mind the ladies at the store said that if i ordered the size up it might be a little longer in the body but that the arms and shoulders would have been the biggest change the material isnt too thick so its a nice lighter layer for fallspring really love it I love the style of this top and the longer length would be great with leggings and fitted shorts its somewhat fitted on the top yet its aline shape gives a full swing at the bottom the ruffled vneckline is pretty and i like the longer length of the short sleeves but with all these attributes unfortunately they cut the armholes really big so when you put your arms forward the sleeves pull against your arms i was trying to decide if i should keep it anyway but for 98 dollars i thin Ordered these online and they fit perfectly i was looking for lightweight pants for hot and humid summer days and this pair is exactly what i needed the striped pattern is cute and adds some color I loved this dress from the moment i tried it on so flattering to my postpartum body without being a huge tent soft fabric and for a whitelightly striped dress not sheer im bummed because after washing only twice followed the instructions to wash on gentle cycle and low tumble dry holes started appearing everywhere both on the cream ribbed hem in the front bottom and all across the chest in the white part of the fabric only it looks like the black stripes are holding the holes toget I went ahead and ordered a size up based on previous reviews but i should have ordered my own size as theyre a bit loose around the waist the pants are adorable and the pinstripes very flattering so i definitely recommend them I really want to love this shirt but the small is just way too big on me for reference im a 32d which is why i didnt want to size down much more than a small 56 and 125 and im drowning in this im going to try it with different bottoms and ultimately will keep it because i do love the quality just size down a couple of sizes Love pilcro love the stripes and the length but this particular pair of capriscrops are super tight fitting i went up a size from my usual and still felt tight i guess its just the cutfabric combo i wanted it to be a slightly less form fitting feel may work for you however This is exactly what i was expecting cute comfortable and casual there are some gold sequins in the scroll work that i didnt see online they are super pretty in person I tried these on in the store and they are super cute but run small i typically wear a size 25 im 5 5 and 108 lbs and they were too tight for me i like the fabric and the cut i think theyd be great one size up my store didnt have them Really nice substantial fully lined sweater coat i love the structured look and the fauxleather piping around the zipper and the pockets quality seems to be very good it runs true to size maybe slightly on the small side especially for larger hipsbusts so if you are in between sizes go up i chose small and its just right i wouldnt be able to zip around my hips with xsmall besides the price which is why i dropped one star i can not really find any fault in this sweater coat Really pretty but runs at least a full size small I love these pants i have worn them a number of times already this season i am 5 so i did have to have them hemmed i lost the bottom button in the process but there are still 3 or 4 on the pants so i dont think they look odd i also wear very high boots with these pants so that helps a crisp white blouse and black leather jacket and i felt like a million bucks I love this tunic the natural color is just that this is a tunic so the fit is a little large i kept it and had it altered because i really do love this top These cropped pants are very light weight and super cute they seem to run just a bit small i sized up one size from my usual and dont seem to stretch so a size larger than you generally take may be necessary the thin pin stripe design is very light in color so they are quite versatile I have this dress on today in white and i am coming back to buy the second color even though pink is not my favorite great comfy casual dress that pairs well with a variety of shoes and jewelry to dress it up highly recommend for summer Size down i love this item it goes perfect with leggings but if you are typically a small you would need to order an extra small and so forth hopefully once i wash this it will shrink some Cute swing top that would be flattering on most i love the print on the white color and its so soft doesnt wrinkle easy but it does run big im usually a s in retailer but i was drowning in it so size down I purchased this top in a regular small and surprisingly it fits me very well im 52 34b 26 waist 36 hips the hem falls about two inches longer than shown on the model i like the vneck the most because the ruffles are not too much and its not too low cut i purchased the white color because i think the pattern is unique and its brighter for springsummer i think skinny jeans and ankle boots or wedges would make the look very stylish by the way the fabric is super soft but not w This skirt is really beautiful but i agree with the other reviewers it runs very small im typically an 8 or 10 if i get a 10 there is usually a bit of room in the item i decided to get a 10 in this skirt just in case i got it zipped but would have trouble breathing as the evening wore on the pockets are wonderful and the fabric is weighty and really lovely Fits well through the shoulders and arms but there is zero waist and it just looks like a bunch of extra fabric hanging from the top super cute but have to return because of that From the picture i wasnt sure how it would fit got in the mail and i love it fits snug when you first put it on and get looser as you wear it definitely should of gotten a large I was hesitant to purchase this coat because of the price and when i received it i have to admit i was a little disappointed with the quality of the coat the sleeves are made out of a soft felted material but i can see this pilling easily other than that the silhouette of the coat is perfectnot too boxy its also not too heavy so that you can wear it through fall and into the first months of winter i love it This top is very cute got it in the lighter color the fit is great and it will go with many things if size medium were not out of stock in the blue color i would have purchased that one also I really wanted to love this t and was excited to receive it in the mail i thought i was being realistic in assuming that is would be somewhat sheer given that there doesnt seem to be a womans white t on the planet that isnt these days however it was really sheer the fit was also short and boxy this coming from a 53 woman who is shortwaisted on the plus size the material is extremely soft and the design is cute maybe if you are younger and dont mind the sheerness its worth the gambl This is a perfect jacket over any shirt tee or dress jacket is well made and goes with anything I ordered this dress in both colors the peach color is so beautiful in person im planning to wear this dress for our rehearsal dinner at the end of the summer if i can hold off until then definitely worth the price This dress is incredible i saw a sales girl wearing it in my local retailer and loved it i bought it in the navy color its gorgeous in person very bright vibrant colors i am 59 34 c bra 27 inch waist and the s was quite big on my waist i kept it anyway because the xs has been sold out and got it taken in a bit i wore it while vacationing in mexico and it definitely turned heads if youre thinking about buying this dress do it you wont regret it Love the look and quality of this jacket iamp39d say it fits true to size but it is way too short for me iamp39m just under 6amp39 tall wish these came in tall sizes I really love the front of this shirt however the back of the shirt is more of a jersey material so it doesnt seem to match the front of the shirt i still wear it and it looks cute but it threw me off a bit at first Absolutely love this dress fits true to size and makes anyone look fabulous I liked the color of this top but i didnt really like the ruffled stitching around the middle it looks like someone just tacked on the bottom half i bought this for my daughter and she likes it i think it is comfortable and a good top to knock around in Per other reviewers i sized up from a small to a medium and the jacket fits me just right with room for layers it is short cropped but i like where it hits me and is versatile for jeans and dresses I have alst years versiona dn they are essentially the smae minus some leather parts removed this jacket is great the back si a little shorter so it goes so well with peplum tops an ddresses with higher waists without looking bigger from the back when the hem is longer and hits where the skirt aprts bulge out i love hte darker color i wish it came is super dark rinse i usually buy petites but i never tired on the eptite in this jacket i am holding myself back to order this on Bought both colors in xs and soooooo glad i did this dress is absolutely gorgeous in either color will have do to the nice quality and wear very stylish for a loooooong time a must have for the summer Comfy sweatshirt with fun polka dot details soft and not baggy a little on the shorter side so i think i will layer a lace cami underneath and it will look even prettier im 57 140 pounds with an athletic hourglass shape 32dd i bought the 2 which equates to a medium since i wanted it a little looser being a sweatshirt im normally an retailer small but i dont think that would have worked in this case as it would have been too fitted great comfy weekend piece I could wear this every day it is stylish and comfortable Pretty top love the color and the large ruffle makes it great for layering or with a pretty necklace Love this top it is a full swing top but the slightly shorter length balances out the fullness perfectly i have been wearing it with a contrasting fitted cami and get tons of compliments love both colors and having fun wearing them and after one washing the fullness is softer and looks like the pic runs true to size and in the arms slightly tight so i went with my usual med and fits perfect if you have issues with sleeve size would recommend going up a size otherwise very true to size The styling of this top is really cute it fits perfectly on the shoulders and gets bigger at the hem for the baby doll look my biggest complaint is the quality its really cheap and feels like the quality i would expect to see at a cheap retailer it catches lint like crazy and because the hem is just a pearl edge it curls really badly i buy quite a bit from here and this is the worst quality item i have seen in a long time not worth the if paying full price Love love love this dress it is very slimming it hugs you without really touching you leaving the tie and a few buttons open gives it more of a casual feel Im 53 130 with a 32dd bust i usually wear small in retailer cloth and stone running horses the small fit me fine but with no room for layers underneath the small was very snug would be perfect for california evenings but i live in the north east the medium still has a great shape on me still fitted at the waist 27inches but enough room to wear a light sweater or flannel under the medium still also looks great over my maxi dress This dress is gorgeous i love it i bought it to wear to a july wedding i got the navy and it is so fresh and crisp in color the sizing is on spot i slipped it on and it was comfortable easy and stylish i am 57 and typically xs it falls exactly as portrayed in the online photos it is lined in the skirt and the top is stretch jersey in the best weight i am in love This shirt is one of my favorite retailer purchases ever it is well made and is perfect for work or the weekend the first time i wore it i received so many compliments I want to live in this sweatshirt its so comfy but also wellcut and lays nicely not boxy at all im typically a 1012 or l in tops and the 3 is roomy without looking sloppy I liked this top even though it was a definite swing style i ended up altering it to remove some of the fullness looks great with jeans as well as black pants for a dressier look very soft and comfortable fabric wish it was just a little bit longer After missing out on last years similar dress i am so glad i finally purchased this one it is beautiful in person i bought to wear to a wedding but i am curious if others think it might be too white i bought the peach color i will keep this dress no matter what hope they come out with more next season Like the other reviewer said this top is extremely wide and boxy it must be pinned in the picture online its very frustrating when they do that thank goodness i didnt pay for shipping for reference im 52 and 135 pounds and bought the xxs its going back for sure im trying to lose baby weight not trying to look pregnant I read the reviews and because this jacket is pilcro i took a chance i was thrilled when i rceived this jacket darker color of denim with weathered edges i absolutely love it dont let it get away great jean jackets are hard to come by I wanted to love this sweatshirt but alas it is going back upon opening and unfolding the first thing i noticed the dots and not solid they are sort of distressed looking with parts of them missing secondly it doesnt have a lot of structure its soft and kind of floppy but in a weird way its just not flattering on me it looks more like a pajama top than something i would wear out of the house for reference i ordered the 3 and im usually a 1012 in tops Love this denim jacket also have it in white the reason i didnt give it 5 stars all around is the distressing is just a bit too much none on the back which is kind of strange id love it even more if it wasnt distressed at all then it could be dressed up much more for work but overall its my favorite great fit and a bit of stretch so very comfy please make this in some other denim colors The cut is brilliantthe wash is subtlethe weight of the denim is sturdy but not stuffand the stretch is just right love it the perfect staple a scarf in the fall and rolled sleeves in the spring Love it the bit of stretch in the denim makes it less stiff than traditional denim I love these im between a 29 and 30 and as the 30s were sold out i had to go with the 29s they fit well as expected very nice fabric good design have to wear a short shirt or one tucked in fabric has a bit of stretch which is also nice Ive been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff id prefer a softer kind of fabric i wonder if it would soften if it was washed also it ran surprisingly small i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didnt leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms the medium worked better i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing i think ill wait and see if this one goes on sal I lost my favorite denim jacket on a trip a few years ago and havent found one i really liked againuntil now great quality just heavy enough but not too heavy just stretchy enough but not too stretchy great colordesign no complaints i read the other reviews and was happy to have ordered one size larger than my normal i typically take a small but the medium in this is perfect it is possible i actually like this jacket better than the one i lost several years ago which is a big endo Beautiful colors and silhouette i got the navy the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk ive gotten a ton of compliments on it im 59 and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee and the low hem falls to my ankles I love these culottes and i think they will be everywhere this coming spring summer the high waist is perfect and looks great with shorter shirts or tuckedin the denim is high quality and a nice medium dark color Im glad i listened to the other reviewersi ordered a large instead of my usual medium its roomy enough for a sweater underneath i love the denim its very soft and has some stretch my other denim jackets are stiff even after years of washing i also love the darker denim Im 54 125 lbs ordered small fits perfect super soft denim love the color love the worn in feel This dress is stunning vibrant colors and flirty feel to it i got the small and i am a 34b27 pants 132 lbs great fit i only question two things am i tall enough to pull off the extra fabric in the back and what the heck do you where for a bra those two considerations are why i didnt give it 5 stars I have been searching for the perfect denim jacket and this it i love the darker color more modern day less 80s it runs a little small i am always either a s or xs at retailer lately their clothes seem to be running a little bigger so i have been an xs in most tops when i order online i never know which size to get i ordered an xs however it was very tight in the arms and across the shoulders i wanted to be able to roll the sleeves up so i returned it for a s and it fits great i was I have received so many compliments its my favorite I wore this dress for the first time yesterday i have never received so many compliments on a dress before several people even stopped me in the streets of nyc to tell me how beautiful this dress was it is an absolute musthave I love the pattern on this jacket and enjoy the bell shape a fun jacket to through on and add quick style to a skinny pants I love this little jean jacket i am petite and usually get a xxsp but went for a size up im glad i did it fits a little snug the color is true to the photo and the material is a medium to heavy denim the arm length in the petite size is perfect for me i love this over maxi dresses tanks etc adorable jacket great buy This dress first caught my eye online due to the price i resisted then i saw in store and tried oni decided to hold off for a sale but my will was getting thin once i saw it start to sell out online i had to take the plunge i knew this dress was a must have it is super flattering and comfy the best of both worlds im smallchested so both the s and m fit but the seam on the s fit a bit higher which was more flattering on me so s is what i got it can be dressed up or slightly down I love this blouse i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging i dont live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively i have larger hips 135lbs 56 and finding flattering tops can be tough sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on they just dont look right some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter this top looked great a First i ordered a m im normally a 810 the m was too small so i returned and ordered a lg the lg fits great but there is a huge area of distressing on the shoulder that will turn into a hole i love this jacket but can not keep it in its condition hopefully i will make it to the store soon there are none win an hour of me and look before i buy I purchased the navy color of this dress not only did it look good but felt good as well since it is for a wedding i also purchased a white crochet cropped sweater to wear over as well making the perfect dress for the mother of the groom could not have been happier This top looks pretty much like it does not the model the sleeves are a nice length and are not too tight the fabric is light weight but not seethrough it does not wrinkle a lot ive gotten several compliments on it and it goes with lots of different bottoms and will work under jackets too the vneck is pretty deep but doesnt show so much cleavage that you couldnt wear it to work Looks beautiful online but has too much material and the zipper catches on the lace also runs very large i am normally a small but would need and xs in this dress True to size on the neckline and arms but extremely large and puffy in the torso very unflattering cut I purchased the floral patterned version and get complimented every time i wear it i found it to be pretty true to size even after washing its a little sheer so youd definitely want to wear a camisole underneath for work its a great top for springsummer I thought this top was adorable in the store and online it just didnt work for me although it fit it flares out too much in the front and just wasnt flattering on me i am 5 5 and 128 lbs and ordered the small Love this top made with 100 cotton a vintage look and flattering details this top is a winner for me i think it fits true to size got my regular size 0 and i did not need the petite and i am fairly short 53 it is somewhat see through but with wearing a nude bra and not wearing it to work i think it can be worn without a cami the perfect lightweight comfortable standout piece for the summer time I really like this blouse a lot very very easy to wear i wore with pencil skirt to work and with skort as shown similar on model with sandals on weekend very flattering and great blue color very happy with this purchase highly recommend i am 56 short torso and my usual 6 worked I just purchased this beautiful printed blouse in the pink color and love it i almost always wear a size small at retailer 34d2735 and the fit and length are both perfect on me if you are smaller chested you can easily go down a size i absolutely had to have this whe i first saw it at the store and noticed how popular it was as i had to order it due to it selling out like hot cakes there what i like about it is the texture and the ruffles at the front plus the length of the sleeves stop ri Bought this on a whim and it exceeded my expectations i didnt know what to expect with the quality of the fabric but this is incredibly soft and warm havent worn it outside yet but i can see this already as one of my favorite items im usually an extrasmall but the xxs also fits its a great buy especially since its on sale now This is an awesome vest so soft cozy and i can not wait to wear it through fall and winter for sake of not repeating all the positive aspects that the previous reviewers did ill mention the one flawno pockets still totally worth full price in my mind though I find that maeve shirts tend to run a little small im usually an 8 but needed this in a 10 this shirt is reallly just perfect great sleeve length just the right amount of v neck beautiful pattern with a vintage feel i love the combo of stripes polka dots and sweet flowers This blouse is so pretty i love the long tie the pattern is very unique it is a thin light weight fabric so you can easily wear it underneath a leather jacket This is a beautiful blousesheer and feminine i am small busted and slender so i need a size smaller than usual it is a full topcant tell exactly how full in the photos but with a small chest there is just too much under the arms so if your chest is more ample you could prob order your regular size this is supposed to be a full shorter fiti would say the style is going to look better on someone who is a little taller with a medium sized bust rather than someone who is shorter and b The photo of these is truly misleading they are a beautiful vibrant print see the closeup photo they are much longer on a regular person they come a few inches above my ankle and i am 55there is a neat slit off to the side on the front of each like a pleat that really allows a nice flow these look great with boots flats and do sit lower on the waste as i think they run slightly large not lined but drape beautifully there are pockets sewn closed upon purchase and pack pockets Like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short im only 52 xs and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model also the quality isnt great as its very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front its a shame bc the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique sadly its going back I didnt think anything of this top online i really dont care for how they styled it but in store it was more interesting im currently anywhere between a 246 xssm depending on the style 53 120lb 34b size 2 regular in this top fit me perfectly for some reason on me the sleeves were elongating and flattering closer to my elbow and the overall length hit me perfectly at the hip like on the model the fabric is lightweight and therefore slightly sheer but due to the color and p Nice fabric and cute design a little low cut I absolutely love this sweater its soft easy to wash and looks great The blue motif is a gorgeous indigo with an interesting pattern a short tunic that drapes nicely and is flattering very happy with this purchase i plan to buy a 2nd for my mom to keep her cool and stylish I had high hopes for this top really boxy short This dress has potential but it didnt work for me it runs true to size to a little big i ordered medium my usual size for maeve as for length it fit me as the model 59 the reason im not keeping it is that i wish it had some darts in the back to help define the waist a bit I love this tee the material is thick but not too thick its highly flattering i love that the sleeves are a longer short sleeve to cover up the bingo wings the shimmer on the front adds something special I got this top in the black and i love it the bottom is a silky material thats really beautiful and the cutout details are really pretty so many of retailers sweaters are enormous but this one fits tts my one complaint is that the bottom white part wrinkles really easily This top was way too short im only 51 and way too wide the cut of this top was so wide it looked like a tent on me i really wanted to love this top because the material and style sleeves ruffle are beautiful unfortunately there is something wrong with the cut ive have several blouses made by one fine day which fit nicely for some reason this top did not i ordered in my usual s size even going to an xs would not work because the cut is wrong My daughter and i both purchased this vest at an retailer store this vest is so flattering on and is so much cuter in person than in the online picture it is chic and stylish and will definitely be a staple for fall and winter This is a great piece to help ease on in to the chillier days of fall and winter its versatile i can see myself wearing it with plain short or long sleeved tees or even tops with more elaborate padderns or button downs theres so many options i can not wait to put this gorgeous piece to use just as an fyi the sleeve openings are slightly unfinished and have a frayed effect to them this may not even be noticeable if youre not looking right up close for me this adds to the unique quality I just got this dress in the mail today and it is even better in person the description didnt give as much information as i wanted so im going to be very detailed in this review i did take off one star for quality because some of the beads are already loose two fell off when i picked the dress up for the first time and ill have to hand sew others on more tightly my usual size is a pxs or p0 and there were no petite sizes available however the size 0 fits perfectly no alterations need When i received this blouse ai noticed that there were gold dots all over the blouse and they were very sticky some of the fabric would stick to these dots i thought it was because the weather was sticky and humid however after hanging on my closet door the dots are still sticky i do love the design and fabric so i will try not to let the sticky dots bother me Wasnt sure about this top based on reviews but glad i purchased pretty print looks great with denim very loose flowy top hangs a little short but thats the style of this blouse fit true to size i usually wear a 24 and xssm with 30dd size small worked for me Ordered the shirt online beautiful print and good quality material runs very large size down 1 may be 2 sizes as the material on the body is very wide i will be exchanging it in the store This too is so beautiful in person there is gold dots all over the blouse that are not overwhelming i love this top with business attire and denim fits tts I tried this in the store and i like it nice and soft good basic design that will pair with many pieces but i decided to wait because of the price im sure i would get a lot of use out of this top but ultimately it didnt thrill me enough to make it my top priority purchase i bought a sweater that was on sale instead still a very nice top i may buy it eventually especially if it goes on sale Gorgeous in every way except its length and how it hangs at the bottom i prefer a shirt i can wear tucked in or out this one will work well tucked in but not out so i am returning disappointed it was so well done in other particulars I bought this in a petite size s after trying on the regular size in the store it was a good move because the proportions in length and width are more flattering the pattern is busy but works well with patterns in the same color group it has no finished seams on any edge but that makes it drape nicely it is a soft soft fabric almost fleecelike but not plush I love how soft the sweater materials is and that the built in layer piece falls so nicely i purchased a small in black and have already worn it with jeans and heels for a dinner and with cropped work pants for the office the bottom piece does wrinkle a lot but you can easily smooth it out really quality materials and on sale this is quite a steal I am 56 138 pounds i purchased this in a size small it is flowy and not too short it has a comfortable but still feminine and beautiful fit one of my favorite new blousesthe red print is gorgeous This top light and airy which is perfect for spring im usually into these types of blouses however this didnt quite fit right on me its a little too boxy and too low cut in the front for some reason i loved the design and really wanted to like it i just didnt love it enough to purchase it This blouse is so beautiful the collar sleeves materialeverything except the cut it was like a tent it needed to be more tapered which would be easy to do while still maintaining the beautiful breezy flow and be about two inches longer i had been drooling over this top for awhile and was so disappointed please fix it and then i will buy again i am 54 140lbs and bustya small was perfect with the exception of the massive amount of material Very pretty blouse i love the print and color of the pink floral tts i ordered the xs because of the roomy cut of the blouse im 58 117 lbs it fit great the cut is a little wider then pictured but still cute not to short as mentioned by another review and i have a longer torso i wasnt crazy about the victorian collar so tucked it under and it looks great I normally wear a large or extralarge the medium is still very billowy on me this blouse is ethereal and lovely though pretty and funky at the same time its sheer but somehow not revealing perfect for when you want to look composed and cool on the hottest day of the summer Not a coat by any means merely a thin wool boucle like sweater with a cheap thin synthetic lining and i also would never want the lining to be seen by anyone if i were to set the sweater on a chair or be helped in putting the thing on the length and bulk is hard to layer under anything else and isnt pretty enough for a spring coatsizing is also 2 sizes larger than anticipated I saw this instore tried it on and was sold it is not just super soft but very flattering on i am petite 105 lbs and bought the xs in black the sleeves are short enough that no petite size was needed i will wear this a lot with both skirts and jeans Love this its heavywarm stylish and a great throw on any outfit oversized style The fabric was nothing special i usually like a cottonsilk blend woven fabric but this was stiff feeling and the pattern was cute but what made me return it was the fact that 1 the rose gold glitter dots are puffy paint literally puffy paint and 2 the dots were not quite dry on my top when it arrived parts of the paint came off on my fingers and the top was stuck to itself because of it i could barely unfold it im sure this could have been cute but who wants a top that looks lik Tts im wearing a small the black goes with so many of my charlie print pants washed nicely layers flat to dry had to iron the shell underneath great for casual office This top is good quality and cute it runs large im usually a medium and needed a small the reason i will be returning it is because it flares out at the bottom on the black which is very unflattering on it makes me look wide in the waist or like im wearing a maternity top unfortunate because i really liked everything else about it Im a pretty solid 1012 in this brand i went with the 12 since some thought the top to run smalland i agree while i can wear it and think it will actually stretch out with wear its tight in the shoulders and chest for the record those are 2 areas i never have problems with im a 36b and it was flattening my chest it was also quite short on me i have a short torso and it was barely hitting below my belly button the shirt felt more like a size 8 than 12 I gave this four stars only because the lining has some polyester polyrayon blend in it and i dont like polyester still i couldnt pass it up due to the chic look and the oh so warm feel of the coat its like wrapping yourself in a warm blanket and the wine color looks amazing its a little on the pricey side since i consider it more of a sweater than a coat i would have liked the price better if it was 100 less it was one of those items that was hard to take off once i put it on i I like this sleeveless sweater it adds warmth and visual interest without adding a lot of bulk paired with blackwhite patterns its pretty versatile as seen in the pics a great staple for a more casual office environment being a taller girl i love the length on it and find its flattering for my curvy figure This blouse is super cute but oddly sized i bought a size up and still i squeezed into the top around the bust the front slit is too low and shows a bit too much cleavage so this had to go back i really tried because the fabric is wonderful and the shirt is light and breezy for summer i just couldnt make it work I love the sweatshirt clay color is very different its a nice light fabric with nice detailed edges although it is an oversized piece it hangs and fits well although i am petite great light sweatshirt for spring and summer Love the patterns and the length i basically would agree with all the reviewers including the person who noted no pockets its really a special piece and on sale very worth it Very comfy and light can be casual with jeans and boots or dress it up with a nice necklace and pencil skirt I got the navy stripe version of this shirt and it has a very cute nautical vibe to it i am either an xs or s in antho and went with the xs for this shirt as i think the s would be too boxy normally i would have overlooked this shirt as its rather unimpressive on the hanger but it was on sale so i tried it on very cute when tried on it fits well across the shoulders but isnt too clingy in the body which i like the fabric is very comfortable and the shoulder detail gives it a little mor Not sure why this shirt is getting bad reviews i am tall and have a long torso so perhaps that is the issue for some who find it not so flattering maybe if your taller it hangs better i have to say i love everything about it it is a fantastic print it is very flowy but i dont think its too much in that regard i think it is fitting with the romantic girly style of the garment in my opinion not too short just right i took a medium i am 58 and athletic I love maeve and was so excited for this top which looked like an update from a last season favorite unfortunately the fabric was stiff it was tight in the chest and went straight down from there returned All the rave reviews are true this vest is plush and funky and i love wearing it im having fun figuring out different outfits to wear with this this is a great three season layering piece and im thrilled i was able to get it on sale my only regret was the lack of a petite selection I love this top i got it on sale and am so glad that i did it is a short too but still super flattering it isnt too boxy on me I tried this on the other day at the local store in a size xss although its wool i didnt notice that is was itchy usually wool bothers me i am of small build but i did like the long oversized look i admit i am drawn to the print anyways i noticed the right armhole was larger than the left so i tried on another xss it was the same probably the armholes will be smaller in the petite sizes i decided to make other purchases but will order the petite xss in a few wks since the invent This has great drape length the pattern is super versatile with solids or prints i am finding the wool to be itchy around the neck so not sure if i will keep though i dont seem to want to take it off has a lightweight boiled wool texture contrasting print and design so cool I was skeptical about this duster and had to see it in person and it was love at first sight the black and white makes it versatile and the pattern makes it interesting and fashion forward more importantly the pattern is cleverly designed which doesnt compete with your wardrobe should you wear a bright color or a similar pattern as shown on model i purchased the regular xss and it fit me fine im 52 34b 26 waist and 36 hips and the hem falls about two inches below my knees the Surprisingly flattering on especially with pantsjeans extremely figure flattering because it enhances the figure and hides flaws the pleating enhances the bust the vcut provides a touch of a peekaboo not enough to show cleavage but its there in a super flattering way the hem flares out a bit to hide the tummy and enhance the bust even more the short sleeves are versatile so it can be worn in the office under a jacket or just plain for going out the material is not too thick but not The top runs small it is a very sexy and slimming top i tried in l it was too small so i have ordered it in xl i hope it fits because it is very fitted and i am worried that the bottom will roll to the top with a fabric like this but it is a very sexy good looking and slimming top i love it I was looking for a basic tee but this one was just okthe quality is okay but it us not as soft as i would have liked unfortunately i will be returning this item An excellent going out to dinner to a lounge etc piece super flattering sexy feminine and trendy can be dressed up or down with some nice accessories im only 5 feet and very wary of jumpsuits but this was excellent I wouldve looked right over this online but i saw it in store and had to try on the navy and the white were both cute but i tried the navy im usually a m but went with the s bc it looked better fitted this shirt has a very vintage feel to it and is slinky and comfy i cant wait to wear would look great with white jeans This elegant white lace dress attracted compliments everywhere i wore it it is classic with just the right amount of quirkiness i like everything about it Ive been looking for the perfect workappropriate lace dress for a casualcreative work environment for a while and this was just the ticket the pointed collar and demure shape add some structure to the feminine lace i rolled the sleeves to a shortsleeve length just to tone done the cutesy factor a tiny bit more although the sleeves worn long are absolutely gorgeous the lace isnt exactly the highest quality lace that retailer has ever used but pretty nonetheless im 55 125 and th Disappointed in the quality of the dress love the style and especially the colors the fabric of the body of the dress is very very thin and just poorly made the top bodice is more substantial not worth the price tag of 14800 dress does run short Comfy cozy and a bit on the big size even for an oversized piece order a size down even if you want a boxier look unsure how the fabric will hold upbut if it does it will be a great get This dress is not what i expected the bottom half is woollike materiallooks like someone has worn it the top snags easily so you must be careful when wearing jewelry when i received the dress i noticed there were two small holes under the arms i wouldnt of paid full price but for the amount i sewed up the holes and packed it away for winter I ordered the sweater in a medium but it was too large so reordered it in the small and it fits perfectly love the length it hits mid hip it is more of an aline than straight as show in the picture the detail is fun and the sweater is well made highly recommend it i have received lots of compliments on this sweater I love this top its design is very pretty and like nothing that i have i think this top runs true to size im usually an xss in tops and i went with the s for this one and it fits great i will say that the top layer of material will snag very easily so while wearing it you have to be very careful This skirt is very short i ordered my usual xs petite and it was so short that the longest part ended above my ankle thats quite off because im only 5 feet tall and i wore it pretty low on the hips it also flares out awkwardly below the knee there are 2 vertical seems and they exacerbate the jagged appearance of the hem i was drawn to the edgy style shown in the photo but in person it looks like my 5 year old cut up a skirt plus the fabricwhile thick and beautiful and stretchyhas a This sweater is of nice quality and has such great detail to it love the pattern to the knit and the ribbon detail is unique and beautiful the knit itself is of mid to thicker weight so definitely appropriate for winter fall and cooler spring days i bought my normal size small and felt like it had more of a slub fit than pictured in the model shot it was wider down the torso and a little shorter not tunic length like picture im 57 with a longer torso and this hit maybe midbum and I really like the appearance of this item and it looks pleasing with many different styles of leggings it does run a little large i am a true to size small and this hangs on me a little but i love the design of the back it is so soft and comfortable I dont normally review my purchases but i was so amazed at how poorly this dress was made i couldnt help myself but to post a review the neck line isnt even hemmed down so it flaps up the material is thin and feel cheap this dress isnt even worth 20 in my opinion i was expecting a well made good quality dress for the high price tag Ordered this dress online and i love it i was looking for an understated but fun new years dress and this was exactly what i was looking for the only minor qualm i had about the dress was that the velvet dots that hit where the seams met made the dress look puffier than it should some parts around the waist but for the most part the dress fit very well and was very flattering may just need a little bit of ironing i am 59 and usually am more conscious of how things fit around my hips and I saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear however after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing so i tried it on what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person and very soft and warm its a perfect winter sweater to start the new year i am 57 138 lbs and the medium fit perfectly though its a little shorter on me than shown in the photos If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you cant fully close this robe the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit the fabric is soft and lux and amazing but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day Like the reviewers before me this dress runs small in the rib cage i normally take a 12 and am a 32b the max size that this dress comes in is a 12 so i could only order a 12 it just fit but that is because i am a smaller 12 on the top there is no wiggle room in the dress that being said it is a really cute style and shape rather like a 50s style dress if you will with a sexy back i am curvy on the bottom and this dress hides the flaws there for sure however because it is a fulle I should have exchanged it for a smaller size but i wanted to wear it so my mistake i tend to wear size 1214 and the large is entirely too big it also had piling right out of the bag but it is just so soft that i tore the tag off and wore it anyway if you get this size down for sure Im surprised other reviewers loved this one so much its completely different then how it looks on the model its much shorter which others do mention but it flares a lot enough to feel maternityish on me it looks fitted on the model maybe its my shape i have a short torso and carry weight in my hips i ordered an xs too i will say the material is very nice and its well made but its going back This sweater is fine for the casual days i bought this in cream and i have to say after one wash it looks old im a huge retailer lover and buy a lot of clothes from them this is just not the best quality and looks tired after a few wears very soft but poor material not my favorite purchase Great fit no bagging and sagging and they fit true to size very cute for reference i39m 5392 115 lbs and take a 26p they look just like they do on the model i highly recommend Just tried layered sadie top and it felt so nice on good hand feel for both materials but note that the knit on top is a little too delicate for machine wash but can be hand washed this item is definitely vanitysized im 51 113lbs and the xs looked nothing like how it does on the model it was flowy as depicted but it came down much lower on me and looked a little maternityesque highly recommend because its gorgeous and well made but i would definitely come in and try it out for you Im 54 between sizes 12 and 14 i ordered a size petite large and its a bit loose which is acceptable but id like to try a regular size medium to see if itd be more fitted like i see in the model my problem is with the length i read the description and it says petite 405 of length the large petite i ordered is above my knees this is not 40 of length by any means its 365 id really appreciate if the size info was correctly available This is a great long sleeve casual shirt for spring soft and airy pairs well with jeans i found that it fit me just right im not very tall but my shoulders are a little broad for my height which typically puts me in the smallmedium range so i got size 6 regular this hits just below the hip and the shoulders are spot on very flattering yolk that gives a little contour to the bust gauzy fabric has wrinkled texture which gives it a casual look and feel my only problem is there aren I love this dress the fit is incredibly flattering and im currently carrying more weight than my normal size i selected a 6 which is about a size larger than normal and it was a perfect fit i tried on a larger size for measure and the 6 provided a perfect fit and flare ive worn the dress on three occasions already and each time friends remarked on their admiration for the dress itself and flattering style for me i have no issues at all with the cut and to me the bias a This top is very light weight and comfortable i am normally a 810 in tops due to my bust size but ordered a 6 based on other reviews it fits great i really like the fit and the pattern it has been a great summer shirt and i can see myself grabbing for it in the fall paired with skinny jeans and a cute bootie This is a precious its a little thin as i prefer a thicker fabric however wearing a tank top under it works perfectly i have it now in both colors great price on sale I got this shirt in red plaid and love it super cute without being too trendy i wore it with shorts and got lots of compliments I originally purchased this dress in a petite 6 i am 53 125lbs with a 36 bust the petite 6 was a bit too tight so i returned it and went up to a size 8 so happy i did this dress drapes and flows beautifully and i find it immensely flattering to my hourglass figure i also adore the floral print one reviewer objected to the way the bodice drapes and the very small hook closure which seemed insufficient i did not object to this characteristic it fit me beautifully throughout the bodice This is not usually a top that i am attracted to but it is so cute paired with jeans and sandals nice lightweight top for summer Im petite and i knew buying this that it would be a big sweater that is the look that is portrayed on the model the sweater is scratchy the neck was so big and bulky i had trouble making it lay right it looks great on the model here but not on me going back so bummed the color gray is true to what is shown and it has little holes or openings across the shoulders so there is a tiny bit of detail overall not a great sweater I was very excited to find a fun and lightweight white dress for springsummer for the past two years i have found two of my favorite white dresses the material that this dress is made out of did not look high quality at all the fit looked more like that of an old nightgown this dress has no shape to it although probably comfortable not flattering i had high hopes for this dress and wish that it looked like it does in the picture in person This dress is very flattering comfortable and made me feel pretty I love this dress but it definitely runs big i bought a size small and im between a 4 and a 6 and will have to return for an xs the top feels like it will fall down and im a size 34c So soft such beautiful fabric it flows so gracefully and looks lovely with black leggings as pictured one of my favorite retailer purchases to date This skirt runs small because of the stitching around the hips the waist fit fine but the hips were very snug and im relatively slim in the hips I bought this sweater because i love twinkles knitting patterns and yarns this sweater doesnt disappoint i love all of the great details like the detachable collar the double buttons along the front and the back panel is in a seed stitch which differs from the front and sleeve stitch its super warm and cozy but its also very heavy depending on the temp outside i can wear this as a coat but i think the sweater will stretch over time because its so heavy Love the look its a little tight but i still like it"
